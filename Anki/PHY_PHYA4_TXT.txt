When a magnet is movied in a coil of wire an {{c1::emf}} is {{c2::induced}} in the wire.	
Electromagnetic induction occurs whenever a &nbsp;{{c1::wire cuts across}} a {{c2::magnetic}} field	
If the wire in which an emf is induced is a {{c1::complete circuit}} then {{c2::electrons}} are forced round.	
The emf induced in a wire can be made greater by {{c3::moving the wire faster}}, making the wire {{c2::into a coil}} &amp; {{c1::using a stronger magnet}}.	
No emf is induced in a wire if the wire is {{c1::parallel to the magnetic}} field.	
For a {{c1::current}} to be induced in the wire it must {{c2::cut lines of force}}.	
When an electric motor is run in reverse it can {{c1::act as a generator}}.	
When motor coils {{c1::turn between}} two poles of a magnet {{c2::emf induced}} in the coil forces {{c3::a current around the circiut}}.	
A dynamo can {{c2::generate electricity}} because it contains a {{c1::spinning magnet}}.	
The emf in a generator is zero when {{c1::there is no motion}}.	
To keep a generator coil spinining {{c1::work}} must be done.	
The induced emf in a wire is {{c1::the energy transferred}} from the source per unit {{c2::charge}} that passes through the source.	
An electric current is the {{c1::charge flow}} per {{c2::second}}.	
Induced emf * {{c2::current}} equals energy transferred p{{c1::er unit charge}}.	
Energy is transferred from the {{c2::induced}} emf to the components of a circuit by an {{c1::electric current}}.	
The Dynamo Rule is also called Flemings {{c1::right hand}} rule.	
Flemings {{c1::right}} hand rule is for {{c2::generators}} not motors.	Left hand rule is for motors.
When a beam of electrons is directed across a field the electron experiences a force at {{c1::right angles to the direction}} of travel.	
Metal contains lots of {{c1::free elec}}trons	
If a metal rod is moved in a magnetic field, {{c2::magnetic}} forces move the {{c1::free}} electrons to one end this makes one end {{c3::negative and one positive}}.	
An AC generator consists of a coil {{c2::spinning}} in a {{c1::uniform magnetic}} field.	
If the coil of an AC generator spins at a steady rate then the {{c1::flux linkage}} changes continuously.	
In an AC generator when the normal to the plane of the coil is at an angle to the flux linkage the flux linkage equals {{c1::BANcos(angle)}}	
The emf induced in an AC generator coil equals {{c1::emf(sin)(2pi)(ft)}}	
In emf(sin)(spi)(ft) the emf is the {{c1::peak}} emf.	This is the formula for induced emf in an AC generator.
The induced emf in a coil is zero when the sides of the coil move {{c1::parallel}} to the field {{c2::lines}}.	
Induced emf in a coil is 0 when the rate of {{c2::change}} of flux is {{c1::also 0}}	
If the coil does not cut any field lines then the induced emf is {{c1::zero}}.	
Induced emf in a coil is a maximum when the sides of the coil cut at {{c1::right angles}} to the {{c2::field}} lines.	
The peak emf induced in a coil = {{c1::2NBlv}}	Where v is {{c2::speed}} and l is {{c3::length}}
The rate at which the magnetic flux is changing is greatest when {{c1::the flux is 0}}	
The rate of change of flux is zero when {{c1::the flux is greatest}}.	
In a power station alternator there are {{c2::3}} coils at {{c1::120}} degress to each other.	
A power station alternators coils produce an AC current emf {{c1::120}} degrees {{c2::out of}} phase with each other.	
Coils in a power station generator are referred to as {{c1::stators}}.	Because they are stationary.
Power station coils do not need {{c2::slip ring}} connectors as an {{c1::electromagnet called a rotor}} spins between them.	
The electromagnet in a power station is supplied by a {{c2::DC}} current which comes from a {{c1::generator}}.	
A power station produces {{c1::3}} phases of {{c2::AC}} power.	
Back emf acts against {{c1::the potential difference (pd)}}	
For back emf: V-{{c1::emf}} = {{c2::IR}}	
The back emf induced is proportional to {{c1::the speed of rotation}}.	
The current induced in a motor chages with the motors {{c1::speed}}.	
A motor at low speed has a {{c2::high}} current and a {{c1::small}} emf.	
A motor at high speed has a {{c2::low}} current and a {{c1::high}} emf.	
The electrical power supplied to a motor is {{c3::equal to}} the electric power transferred to mechanical power + the elecric power {{c1::wasted}} due to {{c2::resitance}}.	
The {{c1::national grid}} is a network of transformers and cables underground and on pylons.	
Power stations in the UK generate a alternating current at a frequency of {{c2::50Hz}} and a pd of {{c1::25kV}}	
The voltage generated at a power station is stepped {{c1::up}} to {{c2::400kV}} for long distance transmission.	
Long distance transmission of electrical power is {{c1::more}} efficent at high {{c2::voltages}}.	
When the voltage is {{c2::increased}} the current needed to deliver a certain amount of power is {{c1::reduced}}.	
At a high voltage the power wasted through {{c1::cable heating}} is reduced.	
Step down {{c1::transformers}} in the national grid operate in stages.	
Factories in the UK receive all {{c1::3}} phases of AC at {{c2::33kV}} or {{c3::11kV}}	
UK Homes are connected to 'the grid' via local {{c1::substations}}. These supply {{c3::single}} phase ac at {{c2::230V}}	The phases are split between different groups of houses.
Transformers are almost {{c1::100%}} efficent.	
Transformers have {{c1::low resistance}} windings to reduce power wastage due to {{c2::the heating effect of the current}}.	
Transformer cores are made of soft iron which is easily {{c1::magnetised and demagnetised}} reducing power wastege through {{c2::repeated magnetisation}}.	
A laminated core consists of {{c2::iron}} sperated by {{c1::layers of insulator}}.	
Laminated cores reduce {{c1::eddy}} currents whilst keeping the {{c2::magnetic flux}} high and the {{c3::heating effect}} low.	
The {{c1::power supplied to}} a transformers primary coil is equal to the power supplied by the {{c2::secondary coil}}.	
[$$]\frac{IsVs}{IpVp} X 100 [/$$] = {{c1::efficiency}}.	
Power = {{c1::Voltage X Current}}	
{{c1::Transformer efficency}} is the power delivered by the second coil devided by the power supplied to the primary coil.	
Transformers only work {{c1::when the flux through them is changning}} so they cannot work on {{c2::DC}}.	
The transformer rule is&nbsp;{{c1::[$]\frac{Vs}{Vp} = \frac{Ns}{Np}[/$]}}	
A Step up transformer has more turns on the {{c1::secondary}} coil and the {{c2::secondary voltage}} is stepped up. The result is that the {{c3::current}} is stepped {{c4::down}}.	
A step down transformer has more turns on it's {{c3::primary coil}} so the {{c1::secondary voltage}} is stepped down and the {{c2::current}} is stepped up.	
Transformers consist of {{c2::2}} coils. A primary &amp; secondary coil. Both coils {{c3::share the same iron core}}. When connected to an alternating pd an {{c4::alternating}} magentic field is producued in the core. And an emf is induced in the {{c1::secondary coil}}.	
Transformers are designed so that all the magentic flux produced by the first coil {{c1::passes through the secondary coil}}.	
The flux linkage in the primary coil of a transformer equals the {{c2::number of turns}} in the coil times the {{c1::flux density}}.	The same is true for the second coil.
The flux linkage in the seconday coil of a transformer equals the {{c2::number of turns}} in the coil times the {{c1::flux density}}.	The same is true for the primary coil.
In a trasnformer an emf is also produced in the {{c1::primary coil}} which {{c2::opposes}} the pd applied to the primary coil.	
In a transformer's primary coil if the {{c1::resistance}} is negligible then all of the applied pd acts {{c2::against}} the emf.	
The emf induced in a transformers secondary coil equals the number of {{c2::turns}} in the coil {{c3::multiplied}} by the flux all over {{c1::time}}.	Equivalent to flux linkage over time.
A solenoid magnet has a field like a {{c1::bar magnet}}.	
In a solenoid the current passes {{c1::colckwise}} around the south pole.	
In a solenoid the current passws anticlockwise around the {{c1::north}} pole.	Draw an N with arrows on it!
Energy is never {{c1::created}} nor {{c2::distroyed}}.	
Lenz law states that the {{c1::direction of an induced current}} is always such that it {{c2::opposes}} the change that caused the current.	
Lenz law is used in {{c1::regenerative}} braking.	
Battery powered vehicles contain alternators that can act as a {{c1::motor or generator}}. When used as an electric motor the motor is driven from the {{c2::battteries}}. However when the {{c3::brakes are applied}} the alternator can be used to generate energy which can recharge the battery.	
Faradays law states that the {{c1::induced emf}} in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of flux {{c2::linkage}} through the circuit.	
Faradays law as an equation is&nbsp;{{c1::-N(change in angle / change in time)}}	
The Product of magnetic flux density and area is equal to {{c1::magenetic flux linkage}}.	
Magnetic flux = B*{{c1::A}} and is measured in {{c2::Webers}} - symbol Wb	
1Wb (Weber) equals 1T (Tesla) per {{c1::metre squared}}.	
The Induced emf is the magnetic flux {{c1::swept out}} by a conductor {{c2::each second}}.	
Magnetic Flux Linkage = {{c1::B*A*N}}	
When the magnetic field is {{c1::perpendicular to the coil face}} the flux linkage = BAN.	
When a coil in a magnetic field is {{c1::turned 180 degrees}} the flux linkage = -BAN.	
When the magnetic field is parallel to the coil area the flux linkage is {{c2::zero}}. This is because no {{c1::field lines}} pass through the coil area.	
For a conductor to move in a magnetic field {{c1::work must be}} done.	
The charge transferred along a conductor in a magnetic field is equal to {{c1::current * time}}.	
Q = I{{c1::t}}	
Work done to move a conductor in a magnetic field = {{c1::Fs}} or {{c2::BILs}}	
When a conductor moves in a field the induced emf = {{c2::W/Q}} = BIILs/It = {{c1::BILs/t}}

Capacitance is measured in {{c1::Farads}} for which the symbol is F. 1 {{c2::Farad}} is equal to 1 {{c3::Coulomb per Volt}}.	
Farads are {{c1::large}} so {{c2::capacitance}} is often measured in micro, nano or pico farads.	
Capacitance = {{c1::Q/V}}	So V = Q/C and Q = CV
Capacitors store energy in the form of {{c1::electrical potential}} energy.

The charge of a capacitor after t seconds is given by Initial Charge * {{c1::e ^-t/RC}}	
RC is the {{c1::time constant}} for a capacitor circuit.	R = Resitance, C = Capacitance, Unit =&gt; Seconds
The time constance of a (discharging) capacitor is the time taken for the capacitor {{c1::to discharge to 37% of its original value.}}	
{{c1::5}}RC is the time for the capacitor to discharge to over 99%	
When {{c1::t = RC}} capacitor charge falls to 0.37 (e^-1) of starting value.	
Capacitors are always discharged through a {{c3::fixed resistor}} until the current reaches 0. This is because {{c2::current}} decreases with pd and so does {{c1::resistance}}.	
The discharge current of a capacitor is proportional to {{c1::charge}} which is proportional to {{c2::pd}}.	
Air is usually an {{c1::insulator}}.	
Large electric fields ionise air molecules by {{c1::pulling electrons out of the molecules}}.	
A lightning strike occurs when a cloud becomes more and more charged, creating a {{c1::large}} electric field between it and the ground eventually the air becomes {{c2::ionised}} enough that it no longer {{c3::insulates}} the cloud and the electricity is discharged.	
Lightning rods reduce the {{c1::risk of a lightning strike}}.	
Lightning rods are connected to {{c2::ground}}, when a charged cloud is overhead a field is created and the air around the rod ionised discharging {{c1::the cloud}}.
