What class are the coolest stars?	M
When do balmer absorption lines for hydrogen appear?	When hydrogen atoms in the star get excited to the n=2 level.

{{c1::Black holes}} absorb {{c2::all light that hit them.}}	
The {{c1::escape velocity}} of a {{c2::black hole}} is {{c3::greater than the speed of light}} - hence they are impossible to escape from.
