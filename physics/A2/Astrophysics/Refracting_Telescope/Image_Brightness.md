Since stars are so far away we can consider them 'point objects' for the purposes of many calculations.

Far away stars can be viewed from a telescope (not the sun which is too bright and would damage the retina causing blindness) where they appear somewhat brighter than if viewed unaided. This is because the telescope has a wider aperture than the pupil (pupil diameter is approx. 10mm) so it captures more light from the star. The amount of light gathered by a telescope in comparison with the eye is proportional to the square of the diameter of the aperture ratio.

For example: A telescope of 5cm diameter and a unaided eye 1cm diameter gives the amount of light collected by the telescope as (5/1)^2 = 25 times more light.
This allows more stars to be seen using a telescope than simply looking up at the night sky.

Unlike stars, planets do not appear significantly brighter when viewed with a telescope to without. This is because the magnification of the virtual image produced which is magnified so the brightness is spread over a larger area.
