Angluar magnification is a measure of how many times an image is magnified. If a telescope under normal adjustment makes a distant object 10 times the size it is making the angle subtended by the distance object to the unaided by 10 times larger.

This is given by the formula:

angle subtended by the final image at infinity to the viewer / angle subtended by the distant object to the unaided eye. This can be shown to be related to the ration of f(objective)/f(eyepeice) where f is the focal length. Sometimes it is also wrtten as β/α.

This formula can be rearranged to find several other useful image properties. The height of the image an be found from f(objective)tan(α). Using the small angle approximation that tan(α) ≅ α this can be reduced to image height = fα.
This applies to the objective lens, the one with the longer focal length. Using the eyepeice gives a dminished image.
