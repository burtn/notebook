A simple telescope need only consist of two converging lenses. One lens has a longer focal length than the other and is called the objective lens. Generally this is the one that is pointed at the object. The other lens is the eyepeice lens because it is the one that the viewer looks through. Adjusting the relative positions of the objective and eyepeice lenses until the image is in focus. This image will be inverted, virtual and magnified.

The objective lenses role is to focus light from infinity to form a real image of the object at the focal point. The eyepeice lens is used to magnify the real image formed by the objective. When the virtual image seen by the viewer is formed at inifinity the telescope is said to be in normal adjustment. Under normal adjustment the distance between the two lenses in the sim of their focal lengths.

The light rays from the object are practically parallel by the time they reach the telescope so it is as if the object is located at infinity. The rays leaving the telescope are also parallel so the viewer sees and image at infinity.

The eye-ring of the telescope is a circle that representst the best position for the viewers eye because the entire image can be seen at this position.
