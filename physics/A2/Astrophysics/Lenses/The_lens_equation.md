The lens equation is:

1/u + 1/v = 1/f

where u is the distance from the object to the lens, v is the distance from the image to the lens and f is the focal length of the lens.

A real image has a +ve image distance whilst a virtual image has -ve distance.
The focal length is always positive with the exception of diverging lenses which are given a -ve focal length.
