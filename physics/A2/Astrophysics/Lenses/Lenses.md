Lenses have numerous real world applications (digital cameras etc). A lens works by modifying the direction at both of its surfaces. Where the light enters and where the light exits the lens.

A converging lens is one which bends parallel rays such that they converge upon a single point called the principal focus or focal point.

A diverging lens on the other hand makes rarallel rays diverge, that is spread apart from one another. The point which appears to be the origin of the raysis the principal focus/focal point in this case.

Prallel rays are those which originate at infinity - because they never cross.

The focal length of both lens types is the distance from the lens to the principal focus.

The plane either side of the lens that is perpendicular to the principal axis and containing the principal focus is referred to as the focal plane.

Differnt images are formed depending on the position of an object relative to the lens that is being used to view it such as through a camera viewfinder or telescope. If the object is beyond the principal focus of the lens the image displayed on a properly adjusted screen is a real image because it is formed where the light rays meet. In this case the nearer that the object is to the lens the larger in size the image is. Conversely if an object is positioned nearer to the lens that the principal focus then the image formed is said to be magnified and virtual. The image is formed where the light rays appear to originate from.
