In a ray diagram...

* The lens is represented by a single line at which refraction takes place.
* The principal axis is a straight line perpendicular to the lens and passing through the center.
* The pricipal focus is the same distance either side of the lens.
* The object is represted by an arrow from the pincipal axis.

A ray diagram consists of 3 rays as shown below

* The first ray runs parallal to the axis then is refracted to the principal focucs.
* The second ray passes directly through the center of the lens without changing direction.
* The thrid ray passes through F on the object side of the lens and is refracted parallel to the axis.

Depending on the position of the object the formed image may vary:

* If the object is beyond 2F a real and diminished image is formed. (see above)
* If the object is at 2F then a image the same size as the object is formed at 2F on the other side of the lens.
* If the object is between 2F and F then the formed image is magnified past 2F on the other side of the lens.
* If the object is between F and the lens an image is formed at infinity on the same side of the lens as the object. This is a virtual image and is magnified.

The magnification of an image can be calculated from: image height / object height which is equal to: image distance / object distance.

A diminished image has a height less than that of the object.
A magnified image has a height greater then that of the object.
