Quite a few astronomers think that a quasar is a supermassive black hole (see black hole notes) at the centre of a galaxy and that when we observe a quasar we are actually 'looking' back in time at a supermassive black hole 'working'. Supermassive black hole action stops when there are no nearby to 'consume' but a spinning supermassive black hole would eject hot matter in opposite directions allong its axis of rotation as a quasar is expected to do.
