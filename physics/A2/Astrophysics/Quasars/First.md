Quasars are some of the oldest, most distant (from earth) objects in the Universe. Quasars or quasi-stellar objects were first discovered for being strong radio emitters though many quasars do not in fact emit radiio waves.

The properties of quasars include their very powerful light output, relative small size and large red shift. This large shift puts them at between 5 and 10 thousand light years away. The speed of recession for quasars is very large - upto 95% (from 60%) of the speed of light. This means that v = zc cannot be used because the statement v << c is false. Instead a relativistic equation must be used - that is an equation that takes into account dilation of time as per special relativity.
