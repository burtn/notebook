Becase the galaxies are moving away from us (as given by Hubbles law) it follows that as well as moving away from us they are moving away from each other as well. As a result the universe must be expanding.

To explain the reason why the galaxies are moving away and the universe is expanding some astronomers proposed that the universe was created in a massive explosion the momentum from this is what still causes the universes expansion today. Opponents to this theory referred to it as 'the Big Bang theory' though it has now become the accepted name. Opponents to TBBT supported another theory called the stady state theory which says the universe is the same now as it ever was. Steady state theory explains the expansion by matter entering through 'white holes' which pushes the galaxies apart. In 1965 however it was discovered that there is cosmic microwave background radiation which couldn't be explained by SST so TBBT became accepted instead.
