Astronomers have discovered that along with the universe expaning it is also doing so at an increased rate. The accelerating expansion of the universe was discovered by the locating of type Ia supernovae that were much further away than expected. Astronomers originally thought that the expansion would slow from the force of gravity but not beleive that the acceleration has been occuring for at least 5 billion years.

Though this has been observed to be the case there is no known force which would provide the acceleration as a result scientists have decided there exists an as yet unknown force which is releasing energy to 'power' the expansion, this is called dark energy because not much is known about it. The strength of the force associated with dark energy is through to be constant unlike gravity which reduces with distance. Current estimates peg the level of dark energy in the universe at 70% of the total energy present today.

The evidence for dark energy and its associated force is based on the differing measurements for distances from two calculation methods. The first is using red shift and hubbles law the second is using type Ia supernovae as standard candles.
