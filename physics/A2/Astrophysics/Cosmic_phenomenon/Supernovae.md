For most of their lives stars are carrying out nuclear fusion. This stops when there are no longer any nueclei in the core that release energy when fused. In this case it is when all the nuclei are iron which has the most stable nucleus possible. As a result they cannot be fused to become even more stable.

If the iron core formed by the end of fusion exceeds 1.4 solar masses in size then the electrons in the core cannot prevent collapse from the force of gravity pulling the core inwards. Instead they a forced into reacting with protons to form neutrons as shown by the following equation: p + e‚Åª ‚Üí n + ùí±‚ÑØ. This sudden collapse of the core rapidly increases the density until it reaches the point at which the neutrons can no longer be forced any closer together. At this point the density of the core roughly matches that of an atomic nuclei. This densest part of the core becomes solid and immovable with remaining matter colliding and immediately rebounding from it in the form of a shock wave which propells the surrounding matter into space in a cataclysmic explosion. The energy from this explosion can allow the star to shine brighter than the galaxy in which it resides. This is called a supernova. Supernova are far brighter than the nova that occur in white dwarf stars. A nova is a star that suddenly becomes brighter so that it appears to be 'new' if it hasn't previously been observed. Novae occur when white dwarf stars accrete matter from invisible companion stars and suddenly overheat triggering runaway nuclear fusion.

A supernovae has approximate absolute magnitude -20 (to -15) so is around 1e9 or a billion times brighter than the sun. The intense heat produced to cause this change allows the formation of elements that are heavier than iron. This means that supernovae remnants contain all the naturally occuring elements. The fact that these elements are present on earth leads to the conclusion that our solar system is formed from the remnants of a supernova.

Supernovae can be classified into types according to their absorption spectra much the same way stars can.

Type I supernovae have no strong hydrogen lines and decrease in brightness steadilly.
Type II supernovae have strong hydrogen lines and decrease in brightness unsteadilly.

The type I category is further broken down into three subcategories - a,b & c.

Ia supernovae show a strong silicon absorption line. All type Ia supernovae have the same peak absolute magnitude (which is known) so can be used as standard candles. This allows the distance to their host galaxy to be found it is the ability to measure distant galaxies that led to the prediction of new dark energy.

Ib supernovae have a strong helium line.
Ic supernovae have neither a hydrogen nor a helium line.
