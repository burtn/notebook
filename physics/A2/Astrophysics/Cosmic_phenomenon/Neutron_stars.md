After all of a supernovas surrounding matter has been thrown off what remains is a neutron star. Neutron stars are extremely small in comparison with the star and extremeley dense also. To illustrate this if the mass of a neutron star was equal to that of the Sun its serface gravity would be over 2 billion times stronger than the Sun's.

Neutron stars where discovered though pulsars in 1967. Pulsars emit radio 'pulses' at around 30Hz. They have extremely strong magnetic fields and are in fact rapidly spinning neutron stars emit radio waves in a sweeping motion in line with the rotation of the star. It is the very strong magnetic fields that  are thought to generate the radio waves, specifically charged particles spiralling in the intense parts of the magnetic field - above the magnetic poles are through to be the cause.
