In all there are two laws of thermal radiation in this topic - Wien's law and Stefan's law.

Wien's law staets that the wavelength at its peak intensity is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature T of the object. This is given as the equation ƛmaxT = 0.0029 m K where m K is metre kelvin. The temperature T in this equation is the absolute temperature of the photosphere which is the light emitting surface of the star.

Stefan's law states that the total energy per second P emitted by a black body at absolute temeperature T is proptorional both the the temperature ^4 and its surface area. The constant proportionality in this case is known as the Stefen constant (σ). This can be expressed as P = σAT⁴ where P is the luminosity/power output of the star. This allows calculation of the size of the star from the temperature and power output.

Any two stars which have the same power output P aslo share the same absolute magntude M. The ratio of the surface area of two stars is the same as the ratio of their two temperatures.
