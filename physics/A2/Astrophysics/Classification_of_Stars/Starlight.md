The light from stars varies in colours, that is it consists of different wavelengths of light both in and out of the visible spectrum. Although appearing white to the unaided eye stars are actually very colourful with colours from red/orange to blue/white.

The thermal radiation from a star of constant temperature consists of a contiuous spectrum of wavelengths. The distribution of the intensity of each wavelength of radiation changes as the temperature increases.

A black body is an object which is a perfect absorber of radiation. A black body also emits a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. Stars are considered black bodies and emit thermal radiation in a continuous spectrum that matches a black body radiation curve.
