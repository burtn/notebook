The light spectrum emitted by a star can be used to calssigy it into one of 7 classes. In decreaseing temperature these are O,B,A,F,G,K,M.

The spectrum of light from each star also contains absorbption lines due to the atmosphere (corona) which consists of hot gasses above the photosphere of the star. The atoms of the gases in the atmosphere abosrb photons of certain wavelengths so the spectrum contains lines that are indicative of the wavelengths that have been absorbed. These lines can be conbared with the obsorbtion spectrum for known elements to identify the elements in the stars atmosphere.

The absorbtion lines of a star can be used alongside the temperature to classify it because they vary together.

The hydrogen absorption lines of a star have a special name to indicate that they are caused by excitation of hydrogen from the n = 2 state. Hydrogen atoms in the ground state, n = 1 do not absorb photons because visible light photons do not have the energy required to excite from the ground state. The lines are called balmer lines and are present in stars of class O, B & A.
