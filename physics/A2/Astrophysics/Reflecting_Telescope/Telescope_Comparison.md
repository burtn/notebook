Reflecting telescopes are, on the whole, considered to be better telescopes than standard refracting 
telescopes. They have a number of advantages, primarily they are shorter and easier to handle than 
refracting telescopes with the same amount of refraction. In addition to this they have greater angular 
magnification than refracting telescopes with comparable length. Image distortion from spherical aberration 
is reduced and chromatic aberration - unwanted colours in the image from refraction of white light is also 
reduced. Since they also have a larger aperture they collect more light.

There are a few advantages to the standard reflecting telescope. Firstly they do not require a complex 
supporting structures that may block some light from the object in reflecting telescope arrangements. 
Although the angular magnification of a refracting telescope is less than a reflector of the same length 
the refracting telescope has a wider field of view which makes locating objects of interest somewhat 
easier.
