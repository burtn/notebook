Reflecting telescopes differ from their refractive counterparts in that instead of a converging objective lens a mirror is used as the objective instead. The concave reflecting mirror that acts as the objective is called the primary mirror. The secondary mirror is far smaller and reflects light from the primary mirror into the eyepiece.

The reflecting mirror is precisely designed such that any parallel rays striking its surface are reflected and focused on a single point called the principal focus. The focal length of a reflecting telescope is the distance from this point to the centre of the mirror.

A cassegrain reflecting telescope differs slightly from the telescope described above in that the secondary mirror is a convex mirror positioned near the focal point of the primary mirror. The purpose of this mirror is to focus light onto a small hole at the centre of the primary mirror. The light that passes through the small hole travels also through the eyepiece.

The image formed be a cassegrain telescope is virtual and formed at infinity.

The magnification by a cassegrain telescope is greatly increased over a normal reflecting telescope because the focal length of the objective is also increased.

To focus the cassegrain telescope the position of the secondary convex mirror is adjusted though it remains 
fixed along 
the principal axis.

Spherical aberration is a effect caused by a spherical reflecting surface because the outer rays of light focus on a point that is closer to the mirror than the point of focus for those nearer the centre. For this reason cassegrain telescopes use parabolic reflectors rather than spherical ones.
