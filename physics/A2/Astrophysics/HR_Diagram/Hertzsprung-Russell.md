The Hertzsprung-Russel diagram is a plot of stars with known absolute magnitudes and known surface temperatures. Theser are plotted in the y and x axis respectively. The temperature scale of the plot (x) is non-linera and decreases from left to right similarly the absolute magnitude scale goes down (becomes increasingly negative) as you move up the y axis.

The HR diagram shows several key star groups. The first of these is the main sequence. This is a roughly diagonal line of stars ranging from cool lower power stars (M = 15) to hot high power stars (M = -5). Stars with larger masses are positioned higher up the main sequence. The star is a main sequence star with M = 4.8, Class G (appox T = 5778 K). Giant stars are also shown on the HR diagram. These stars have ranges of M from 2 to -2 so they emit more power and are upto 100x larger than our sun. Red giants though are cooler than the sun. Supergiant stars are even larger (upto 1000x the suns diameter) they are relativly rare and have M values from -5 to -10. White dwarves on the other hand are hotter than the sun though they are smaller and emit less power. These stars have M values of 15 to 10.
