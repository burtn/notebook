In order to calculate the power output of stars other than the sun their absolute magnitude has to be known in comparison with the sun (M = 4.8).

In the absolute magnitude scale each 1 step in magnitude is a brightness in crease by a factor of 10^0.4 (≈2.512). This can be genaralised such that (10^0.4)^ΔM is the number of times brighter the star is in comparison with another - usually the sun.

Example:

The sun has a magnitude of 4.8, how many times more powerful is a star of -0.2?

ΔM = 4.8--0.2 = 5
(10^0.4)^5 = 100 therefore the power output of this star is 100 x power output of the sun. (= 100 * 4e26 = 4e28). 

The area and diamter of a star can be found with stefans law from this value and the surface area. Note though that power output from stefans law does not include non visible radiation e.g. UV or IR.

In comparison with the sun a star can either be a dwarf or a giant.

Dwarf stars are much smaller in diameter than the sun.
Giant stars are much larger in diameter than the sun.

Generally when comparing two stars it can be asumed that if two stars have the same surface temperature but differing absolute magnitidues then the one with the greatest power output has the larger diamter/area. If on the other hand the surface temperatures are different by the absolute magnitude of each is the same then the hotter star is smaller.
