Unlike radio and IR telescopes ultraviolet telescopes (UV) must be placed on satellites. This is because UV radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. UV telescopes consist of mirrors to focus the radiation because lenses would also absorb UV. The mirrors focus the UV onto a detector much like in the IR telescope.

UV radiation is emitted by atoms that are at high temperatures so UV telescopes can be used to view objects like quasars and supernovae. It is also useful to combine visible light images with UV images to highlight 'hot spots' on an object.

Examples of UV telescopes include the HST, IEU and XMM-Newton.
