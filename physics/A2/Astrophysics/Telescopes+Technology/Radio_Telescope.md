Radio telescopes consist of an aerial centered in a parabolic dish made up of wire mesh. The arial position is at the focal point of the dish. Many radio telescopes can be combined into a large array of telescopes to produce a larger image. Radio telescopes can be positioned on the ground because they atmosphere transmits radio waves from 0.001 to 10m in wavelength. Radio telescopes can often be rotated to reduce the effect of the earths rotation and view other parts of the sky.

The signal from a radio telescope consists of the intensity measure of the received radio waves as the telescope scans across the source. This data is fed to a computer which performs the analysis.

The wire mesh reflector must have a mesh spacing of less than ƛ (wavelength)/20 in order to reflect radio waves onto the aerial.

The collecting are of the telescope is given by the formula
(¹/₄)πD²

The resolving power of the telescope is given by the formula
ƛ/D

...where ƛ is wavelength and D is diameter.

Examples of radio telescopes include the Lovell radio telescope, Cheshire, UK and the Arecibo observatory, Arecibo, Puerto Rica, USA.
