The main component of a infrared telescope is its concave reflector. The concave reflector focuses infrared radiation to a focal point at which a infrared detector is sited. Many objects in space emit IR radiation including planets and dust clouds. Some objects are not hot enough to emit light but can emit IR radiation which allows them to be seen with IR telescopes.

IR telescopes can be situated either in space on satellites or on the ground. The best conditions for IR telescopes are in space where they are unaffected by water vapour (which absorbs IR) and do not need to be cooled as much. Ground based telescopes have to be cools significantly more in order to stop IR radiation from its surface interfering with itself.

Examples include IRAS and the Hubble Space Telescope, HST.
