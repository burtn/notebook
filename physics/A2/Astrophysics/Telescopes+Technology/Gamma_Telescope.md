Gamma ray telescopes as with IR, UV and X-ray have to be positioned in space. They word by detecting gamma photons which pass through a detector made of pixels. As the photon passes through the pixel it tirggers a signal which allows the direction of the photon to be determined.

The International Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) is an examples of a gamma ray telescope and is used to study supernovae and black holes.

The diffraction of both X-rays and gamma are negligible owing to their short wavelengths so the resolution of the image is given by the pixel seperation.
