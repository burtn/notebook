To be able to discren two distinct stars in the sky their central points of diffraction must not overlap. This is represented using the Rayleigh criterion which determines that resolution of two points is impossible if any part of the central spot of either image lies inside the first dark ring of the other.

It follows from this that the angle of diffraction must be at least if not greater than the angular seperation of the two points. The angluar seperation of two points is the angle between straight lines between the observer and the objects.

Therefore to see two points the angluar seperation must be greater than or equal to ƛ/D ⇒ θ ≅ ƛ/D.
