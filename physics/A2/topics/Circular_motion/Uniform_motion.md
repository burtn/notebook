Any object which is rotating at a steady rate is travelling in uniform circular
motion. For a disc with circumfrence 2 times pi times the radius the frequency
of rotation will be one over T, T being the time for one complete rotation.

Objects in circular motion also have an angluar displacement and an angular
speed. The angular displacement for an object is given by theta 2 pi t over T or
2 pi t / T. Again T is the time for one complete rotation. Angular speed is
linked to angular displacement as it is the angular displacement per second.
Angular speed is measured in radians per second and can be found from the
formula two pi multiplied by the frequency.

The velocity for an object moving around a circle changes directions constantly whilst the speed
remains the same. Since the velocity is constantly the object must also be accelerating. This
change in direction is always towards the centre of the circle so the acceleration is also towards
the center of the circle. Centripetal means towards the centre of the circle, so the acceleration
is known as centripetal acceleration.

Centripetal acceleration is equal to the velocity squared devided by the radius of the circle.
This is because if an object moving in a circle with velocity V in time delta t (a very small
period of time) from one point to another, say A to B the distance moved will be the velocity (V)
multiplied by the time (delta t) from the standard speed, distance and time formula (speed equals
distance over time). It can also be said that the line between the object and the centre of the
circle moves through an angle theta (the greek letter) and the change of velocity is the velocity
at B minus the velocity at A.

In order for an object to move around a circle
