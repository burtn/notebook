Any object which is rotating at a steady rate is travelling in uniform circular motion. For a
disc with circumfrence 2 times pi times the radius the frequency of rotation will be one over T, T
being the time for one complete rotation.

Objects in circular motion also have an angluar displacement and an angukar speed. The angular 
displacement for an object is given by theta 2 pi t over T or 2 pi t / T. Again T is the time for 
one complete rotation.
