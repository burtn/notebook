Newtons third and final law of motion states that when two objects interact they exert equal and
opposite forces on each other. So for example an object at rest on a surface exterts a force
downwards on that surface due to gravity and the surface exterts an equal and opposite force on the
object.

When objects interact momentum is always conserved because of the PCM or Principle of conservation
of momentum. The principle of conservation of momentum states: the total momentum remains constant
provided no external resultant force acts on the system. Note that momentum can be transferred
between objects.

If two objects were to collide head on the collision could possibly result in the both objects
coming to a standstill. The momentum in this case would be zero, this can only happen if the initial
momentum of each object was equal and opposite.
