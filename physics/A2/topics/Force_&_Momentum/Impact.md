An impact changes the momentum of an object in a relitively short period of time. The impace force
for a stationary object is equal to the change in momentum over time, which is also true for an 
already in motion object however the change in momentum is now the final momentum minus the initial
momentum.

Plotting a force versus time graph would show that the force increases and then decreases during the
impact. When an object rebounds the direction of its velocity and therefore also the direction of 
the objects momenum has changed. If the object had hit the wall normally the only difference
between the momentum before and after would be the change in sign.
