There are two types of collisions, elastic and inelastic. For a collision to be called elastic 
there must be no loss of kinetic energy. On the other hand an inelastic collision is one in which
the colliding objects stick together because the kinetic energy will be less after the collision.
There is also a partially inelastic collision, also characterised by less kinetic energy after the
collision however unlike a fully inelastic collision the colliding objects more apart.

The type of collision can be determined by calculating the kinetic energy before and after a
collision.
