The transferal of pollen from one flower to another is called pollination. Pollination generally occurs to the stigma of a flower that is of the same species. Pollination allows fertilisation to occur since it brings the male and female gametes together.

Some species of flower may self-pollinate. This is where the pollen from the anthers of a flower are only transferred to the stigma of that flower or one that is present on the same plant. Cross-pollination on the other hand occurs is the majority of known plant species and involves the transfer between flowers of different plants of the same species.
