The sex cells of a flower develop in both the anther (for male sex cells) and ovary (for female sex cells). Initially there are diploid cells in the anther which underfo meiosis into haploid cells which later become pollen grains. These pollen grains are surrounded by tough walls which are resistant to desiccation. Resistance to desiccation is what allows the pollen grain to be transported from flower to flower without it drying out.

Further mitosis occurs in the pollen grain - dividing the nucleus to produced two nuclie. One of these nuclei will be the tube nucleus and the other the generative nuclues which itself will go on to generate two more nuclei which take part in double fertilisation. The pollen grains are not released until after this division and they have matured. When the pollen grain is sufficiently matured the anther becomes dried out (tensions are produced in grooves) and dehiscence occurs. This is the curling of the pollen sacs to reveal the pollen grains.

The female gamete (egg nucleus) on the other hand develops inside the ovule which is produced in the ovary of the flower. Inside the ovule a mother cell undergoes meiosiss forming an ambryo sac which is haploid. Inside the embryo sac eight nuclei form through metosis - two of these are polar nuclei and one is the egg nucleus.
