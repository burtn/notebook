Seeds can be broadly classified into two groups. Dicotyledons which have two seed leaves (cotyledons) and monocotyledons which have only one seed leaf or cotyledon. The broad bean is an example of a dicotyledon whilst the maize plant is a monocotyledon example.

The broad been (Vicia faba) seed food store is absorbed into the cotyledons. Maize however often have endosperm consisting of cereal grain which surround the cotyledons. In fact the monocotyledon group includes cereals. The arrangement of food storage in the maize plant actually makes the maize a fruit rather than a seed which is the hard part within the maize (think sweetcorn).
