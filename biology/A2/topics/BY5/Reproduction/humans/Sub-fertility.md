One in six people in the United Kingdom seek medical assistance because they have difficulty conceiving. Difficulty in conceiving naturally for any reason affecting either the man or the woman is known as sub-fertility.

Infertility on the other hand is the inability to conceive a child at all. Infertility unlike sub-fertility is a rare condition.

Infertility has two primary causes. The first of these is blockage of the Fallopian tubes. This can be caused by infection but can be treated. For example by microsurgery. Any blockage of the Fallopian tubes prevents the passage of the ovum to the point where it is fertilised making it impossible to conceive.

The second (primary) cause of infertility is failure to ovulate. Persons suffering from this tend to also have abnormal menstrual cycles. Treatment often takes the form of the drug clomifene which inhibits oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus.
