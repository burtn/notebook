Gametes are haploid male or female sperm cells which are produced in the gonads. The process by which gametes are formed is known as gametogenesis. Gametogenesis can be further divided into two separate processes, one for sperm and one for eggs. Spermatogenesis is the process which produces sperm in the testes whilst Oogenesis is the formation of ova (eggs) in the ovary.

The germinal epithelium of the testes and of the ovaries go through a series of meiotic and mitotic 
divisions to form haploid gametes. The gametes must be at haploid so that when the zygote is formed it has a diploid number of chromosomes.
