A key part of the female reproductive system are the ovaries of which there are two. The ovaries produce the ova (eggs). Specifically ova are produced in the germinal epithelium where they become follicles, these follicles mature and the ova is shed. The ova then pass from the ovaries into the fallopian tube (also known as the oviduct) which carries the ova to the uterus. The uterus has muscular walls with a mucus membrane (the endometrium) and a large blood supply.
Once the ova reaches here it implants if fertilised or is shed through menstruation. The uterus is connected to the vagina by the cervix - a ring of muscluar tissue.
