Sperm consist of a head piece, middle piece and tail. The head of the sperm contains the nucleus in front of which is the acrosome which contains enzymes for breaking down the walls of the egg cell during fertilisation. Behind the head is the neck and the middle piece. The middle piece contains a large number of mitochondria which provide energy in the form of ATP which is used in the tail to propel the sperm along.
