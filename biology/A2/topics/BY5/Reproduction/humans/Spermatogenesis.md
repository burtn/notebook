Spermatozoa (mature sperm cells) are produced in the process of spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis takes place in the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubule - a part of the male reproductive system. The germinal epitheliumn cells divide into spermatogonia which themselves undergo division many times through mitosis to produce primary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocytes become secondary spermatocytes which are haploid cells through one meiotic division. Seconday spermatocytes undergo one further meiotic division to become spermatids which later differentiate into spermatozoa.

The seminiferous tubule where this process occurs has sertoli cells within its walls. These cells secrete a fluid which provides nutrients for the developing sperm cells (spermatids) and protects them from the bodies immune system which would otherwise attack them. The male sex hormones (androgens) are also secreted here.
