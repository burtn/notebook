Oogenesis is the process by which the female gamete is formed. The female gamete is the ova which is produced in the two ovaries of the female reproductive system. In the developing female foetus Oogonia are formed which undergo meiosis to form around 2 million primary oocytes before birth. These primary oocytes also start division by meiosis but stop at the prophase one stage, they stop maturing until just before ovulation. Around this point the germinal epithelium also divides to form follicle cells. These cells then surround the primary oocytes to make primary follicles.

When puberty is reached hormones stimulate the follicles and cause them to develop further. This happens monthly and only one of the follicles fully matures into a Graafian follicle. The development at this stage consists of the primary oocyte completing the first meiotic division and so forming a haploid secondary oocyte as well as a polar body (the first of many polar bodies to be produced). The now matured graafian follicle migrates to the surface of the ovary where it causes the ovary to rupture, releasing the secondary oocyte in the process which is known as ovulation.
