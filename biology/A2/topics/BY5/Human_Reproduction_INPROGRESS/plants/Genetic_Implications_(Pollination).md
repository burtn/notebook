Self-pollination is analogous to in-breeding. As such it shared many of the same disadvantages. These disadvantages include reduction in variation and the size of the gene pool for a given species. Another more serious disadvantage is that two undesirable recessive alleles have greater chance of being paired in fertilisation if self-pollination occurs.

Conversly however self-pollination can help to preserve good genomes so is possibly more suitable if the environment that the plant currently inhabits is a stable one.

Flowers are adapted to cross pollinate through one of two methods. These methods are: insect pollination or wind pollintation. Insect pollinated flowers often have colourful petals with scent to attract insects. Such flowers may also produce nectar from their nectaries in order to attract insects such as bees which feed upon it. Bees feed on sugary nectar...
