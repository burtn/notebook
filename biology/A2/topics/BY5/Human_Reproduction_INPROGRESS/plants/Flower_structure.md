Flowering plants are referred to as angiosperms. Angiosperms are the most successful of all terrestrial plants. Flowers consist of petals which are brightly coloured so that the attract insects, a sepal which protects the flower in bud and so often remains uner the flower once it has blossomed. The flower also has both male and female reproductive organs. The female reproductive system further consists of the style which supports the stigma - the receptive surface for pollen. The flower also contains the embryo sac, ovule and ovary which are situated just above the receptacle.

The male parts of the flower are the filament and stamen which it supports. The actual pollen grain producing part of the flower is the anther which is also said to be male.
