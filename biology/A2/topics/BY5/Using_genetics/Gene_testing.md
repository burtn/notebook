In order to test for gene mutations scientists obtain DNA samples from a number of patient or patients and scan the sample for mutated genes. A gene probe (a short section of DNA whose sequence is the complement of the strand that is to be looked for) is used for this because they seek their complement from the three billion pairs that make up an individuals genome. Should the mutation be found the probe binds to it and 'flags' the mutation to scientists.

There is another method that can be used for DNA testing. It involves comparing the DNA sequence from the patient to a known normal version of the gene. Because these tests can take time and labour that varies with the size of the genes and the number of mutations which have to be tested against these tests are often expensive.

Genetic testing is used in a wide variety of scenarios.

* Pre-natal diagnostics and newborn babdy testing (e.g. Hereditary conditions)
* Carrier screening
* Pre-symptomatic testing for adult onset deseases (e.g. Huntingtons) and predicting risk of onset (e.g. Alzheimers)
* Forensic testing (e.g. Identity, paternity etc)

Knowing the results of a genetic test can have wide reaching consequences on the way an individual chooses to live their life. For example if you have been been tested as a carrier for cystic fibrosis and the test comes back positive you might choose not to have children in case they become a sufferer. Alternatively you might choose to abort a child if an antenatal test showed it could suffere from a desease like this.
