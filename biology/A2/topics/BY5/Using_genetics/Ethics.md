Ethics can be loosely defined as either "Moral principles that govern a person's or group's behavior" or "The moral correctness of specified conduct". The definition depends on the context.

Tissue culture is an example of a scientific research area that causes a fair share of controversy. The main cause for concern is over the use of stem cells. This is because the best source of stem cells is very early embryos. These embryos are sourced from fertility treatment patients because there are excess embryos that are not implanted into the uterus during the treatment. These embryos can havee their stem cells removed for research purposes after which they are destroyed. Opponents of stem cell therapy consider in unacceptable that the embryos are used in this manner despite the fact that the embryos would never have developed regardless of their use in research. They (the opponents) say that the technology which allows use to do this are a slipery slope to reproductive cloning and the devaluation of 'life'. There are often religious reasons for this - e.g. 'playing God'. However the stem cells can be used to treat a wide spectrum of diseases from Alzheimers to multiple sclerosis as well as more common diseases like heart disease. Even cancers have the potential to be treated in this manner. Many would argue that this outweighs an ethical concerns that arise.
