The polymerase chain reaction is the semi conservative replication of DNA that takes place in a test tube. To carry out the reaction the DNA is added to a buffer (pH controlling) and enzyme (DNA polymerase) solution. To this solution nucleotides are added for building the new DNA strand along with short pieces of DNA called primers. These primers trigger the DNA polymerase to start the replication process. The reaction is used to produce large quantities of DNA - this involves repeating the following steps many time with each pass doubling the quantity of DNA.

To begin the target DNA is first denatured by heating it to 95 degrees C, this is important because it causes the DNA to separate into two strands. The two strands form because the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs break under the energy they have. The enzyme, buffers and so on are then added as the solution is cooled to 55 degrees C. This causes the complimentary base pairs to join with the primers, this in turn triggers the DNA polymerase to carry out the replication of each strand. The solution then has to be heated to 70 degrees C to catalyse the synthesis of a complementary strand for the currently single strands, this produces two identical DNA strands. The enzyme DNA polymerase is unaffected by the heat so this process is repeated to increase the DNA by a factor of 2 each time.
