Micropropagation is also called plant tissue culture and is a technique used in the cloning of plants. Micropropagation is based on the fact that differentiated plant cells can give rise to all the different plant cells that would normally be found in the adult plant. Under the correct conditions plant cells can develop into any other cell because they are totipotent, that is capable of differentiation.

Micropropagation is also sometimes called test-tube plant culture and is a relatively recent development in comparison with conventional plant propagation methods such as taking cuttings.

To carry out micropropagation the plants meristems are are exposed and cells removed from the meristem to be placed in the correct conditions. The meristem is a growing point of a plant where the cells are rapidly deviding through mieosis. The tissue here is called meristematic tissue and can be ised to develop new genetically identical crops from a single parent of which they are clones.

Generally micropropagation takes place in the following steps.

* A plant is selected to be cloned, this is often the one with the most desirable characteristics.
* A scalpel is used to seperate the root and the meristem in aseptic conditions.
* The meristem is cut into small tooh sized pieces called explants.
* The explants are placed on sterile medium such as agar jelly which is aerated and provides the plants with all the nutrients and chemicals it needs.
* The exoplant cells divide by mitosis.
* The exoplant becomes a mass of undifferentited cells called a callus.
* The callus is cut down into a number of peices which are incouraged to develop (differentiate) into a plantlet.
* Plantlets are transplanted into sterile soil at the appropriate time.

There are wide ranging reasons for micropropagation to be carried out. It is a process which has a number of advantages. The most obvious of these advantages is that large number of the  plants can be grown in sterile conditions. This sterile environment free from harmful bacteria and other parasites means that the cloned plants have a greater chance of surviving than if seeds were simply planted outside. Resistance to disease or high yield can also be selected for in the parent of the clones making sure that good quality stock are eventually produced.

Having desirable characteristics has comercial value as does the uniformity of the crop if crops are propagated. Micropropagation can also be used to preserve unique genotypes and in general micropropagation requres little space both for storage and for transport thereby reducing heating, lighting and transport costs.

Naturally there are also disadvantages to micropropagation. The primary disadvantage is the lab time required. Sterile conditions have to be maintained until the plants are ready to be planted out otherwise some of the plants are likely to die from fungi or bacterial contamination. The resulting plants from the process are also genetically unstable. This is because of an increased mutation rate in the cells that are grown in the nutrient medium that causes abnormalities in the resulting plantlets. To 'nip' the mutated plants in the bud requres workers to regularly inspect the plants and remove defective individuals pushing up costs further.
