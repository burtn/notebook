Farming is one of the ways in which human beings act to reduce biodiversity. This is because farminng is becoming increasinly more advanced (technologically speaking) and efficient in order to keep up with the intense demands of human food consumption. A number of changes which make taken place since the end of world war two have had a large impact on the environment - primarily because mechanisiation was introdiuced but also becuase fertiliser and pesticide usage also soared.

The impact on the environment from these changes is realted to the growing size of fields to accomodate large machinery. To get the machinery into the field hedgerows had to be removed - taking away a vital habitat for many small animals such as mice and birds. Further in the large fields farmers tended to only grow one crop such as wheat or maize. This is known as a monoculture. A monoculture is the growing of a large number of crops which are of a simplar type as well as age and that are grown simultaneously. Monocultures result in reduced species diverity and in the long term lead to decreased year on year yield. The decline in yield can be attributed to one of two factors. The first of thse is mineral depletion in which intensive cultivation of the crop requires an ever increasing amount of nitrate (inorganic) fertilisers. As well as more fertiliser intensive cultiation attracts pests and crop related diseases therefore increasing amounts of pesticide must also be used to kill of the pests which are usually insects.

Farming however is changing. In 1995 with the passing of the Environment act the UK government reversed the removal of hedgerows. Hedgerows are perhaps the most important habitat in a heavily farmed area. This is because hedges act as wildlife corridors which allow animals to move between different areas of woodland which also maintains the woodland biodiversity. Hedges also provide habitats and nesting sites for a wide range or birds and animals which live and feed on the other animals such as insects present in the hedgerow.

In general people have become far more aware and protective of 'their' countryside so farmers have been ecouraged to manage their farms to increase biodiversity incuding grants for giving up land for conservation efforts.
