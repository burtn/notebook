The Chi-squared statistical test can be used to determine if observed results are close to those which are expected or if something is happening to affect the results other than chance.

The Chi-squared test is carried out as follows:

- Calculate the set of expected values (E)

- Calculate the set of differences between the observed (O) and expected (E) results. This is done with the formula Sum (Sigma) ((O-E)^2 ) / E

- Calculate the 'degrees of freedom'. The degrees of freedom are a measure of the spread of the data equal to the number of classes of data minus one.

- Using a Chi-sqaured table the significance of the diviation can be determined. If the deviation is less than 5% then it is significant and an unknown factor is affecting the results.
