There are two key forms of allele linkage. The first is Sex linkage. Sex linked allleles are carried on the X chromosome. Sex linked alleles are not carried on the Y chromosome because it is significantly smaller than the X chromosome and as a direct result has very few genes. This means that recessive alleles on the X chromosome will always be expressed in the phenotype of a male because they are unmatched with an equivelant dominant form because one is not carried on the Y chromosome. Recessive genes on the X chromosome cannot be passed from father to son because for they son must receive the fathers Y chromosome. Daughters however muat receive the recessive allele on the X chromosome. If the female only recieves one copy of the recessive allele then they are a heterozygous carrier, if they have two copies however they express the characteristic in their pheotype. Female carriers have a 50% chance of passing on the allele to their son(s).

Haemophillia is an example of a sex linked condition. Heamophillia means that an individual cannot produce a clotting factor thereby preventing their blood from clotting and causing slow, persisant bleeding. The recessive allele codes for factor 8 (VIII) a protein which is takes part in the clotting process.

Whilst the symptoms of heamophillia can be minimized using the clotting factor from blood donations the chance that it may be passed on to offspring will always remain.

Linkage can also occur on other genes. Linked genes which are present on the same chromosome pass into the offspring remaining linked. Linked genes do not result in Mendelian ratios unless recombination occurs. Recombination is where alleles are exchanged between homologous chromosomes through the crossing over step process in meiosis. Since crossing over only happenes in upto 10% of cells undergoing meiosis that changes are the very few gametes will have recombinant genes and so practically nil offspring will have the recombinant genes. However the distance between each gene determines the chance of crossing over taking place with longer distances increasing the chance.
