Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a single pair of characteristics which contrast each other. Gregor Mendel was the first person who worked out how genes are inherited. As a result of his experiments he formulated two laws. These two laws form the basis of genetics. Mendel's first law is known as the law of segregation and it states:

"Every individual possesses a pair of alleles (assuming diploidy) for any particular trait and that each parent passes a randomly selected copy (allele) of only one of these to its offspring."
