Any change to an organims DNA is a mutation. Mutations may be localised to one gene or may effect many genes, even the whole chromosome. Mutations are very rare because they occur randomly and in a spontaneous manner which results in a low mutation rate in a population. Whilst the variation caused by mutation can impact evolution because it provides characterisitcs on which natural selection pressures can act they do not have as much impact as other variation sources such as independant assortment.

The organisms which are most affected by mutations are those which have relativley breif lives. This is because as a species/population they undergo meiosis much more frequently than long lived organisms increasing both the chance that mutations occur and the overall mutation rate.

Mutations occur of their own accord but the mutation rate can be increased by exposure to mutagens. These are agents which cause mutations. Examples of mutagens include Ionising radiation (X-rays, UV, gamma), Viruses such as HPV, Chemicals such as tar in cigerettes. As well as these mutagens some mutations are linked to hereditary predisposition in which an organism inherits the tendency to have a particular mutation occur.

Some mutations can cause cancer, in this case they are called carcinogens. All carcinogens are mutagens but not all mutagens are carcinogens. Mutations occur in one of two ways: Incorrect copying of DNA and Chromosome damage. If DNA is not correctly replicated before cell division it can result in new faulty chromosomes. These mutations are often confined to one gene so are known as point mutations (sometimes as gene mutations). Note though that only mutations like these that occur in gamete formation have the chance to be inherited by offspring. Chromosome damage is usually reversible, the DNA that is broken will rejoin should the chromosme break. On occasion however the chromosomes may not repair themselves correctly - this is a cause of chromosome mutation and has serious consequences because it affects a large number of genes.

Point mutations can cause changes in the phenotype of an organism. When a point mutation occurs a different allele is produced. The point mutation can take the form of an addition, deletion, duplication, inversion or substitution. All of thse mutations change the polypeptide produced in protein synthesis by changing the primary structure of the protein becase if the modified amino acid which is built into the chain.
