The gene that codes for Haemoglobin can undergo a point mutation in the form of a substitution which results in the formed Haemoglobin being Haemoglobin S rather than standard haemoglobin. Haemoglobin S is the form of Haemoglobin responsible for sickle cell anaemia. Haemoglobin S has the wrong amino acid in two of its polypeptide chains which causes the cell to become sickle shaped. Sickle cells struggle to carry oxygen so cause anaemia.

The gene which mutates is co-dominant. For a homozygous individual the individual will suffer from the disease. Heterozygous individuals however are carriers and have only 30/40% sickle cells with the remaining 70/60% of their blood cells having normal haemoglobin. This heterozygous condition is also referred to as the sickle cell trait.
