The final pair of human chromosomes - pair 23 determines sex in humans. Males have two different sex chromosomes one X and one Y. Females on the other hand have two similar X chromosomes XX. Because females are homozygous in terms of sex chromosomes their eggs only contain the X chromosome. For male sperm cells however because of the presence of both X and Y chromosomes in the parent the sperm cells contain 50% of Y chromosome and 50% of the X chromosome.

Drawing out a genetic cross for sex chromosomes shows that there is an equal (50%) chance of being either a boy or a girl.
