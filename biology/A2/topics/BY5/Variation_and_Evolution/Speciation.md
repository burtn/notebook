Over time individuals the were originally members of the same species can become part of two completely distinct species. The formation of a new species is called speciation.

In a single species population there exist further sub groups called demes. Demes are interbreeding sub units which tend to breed among themselves more often than they breed outside their deme. A new species is formed when there is a 'reproducitve barrier' that prevents reproduction from occuring between demes. This prevents the 'flow' of genetic material between demes and in the long term causes the two groups to be sufficiently different that a new species with its own gene pool incapable of breeding with the parent species is formed. The 'reproductive barriers' which cause this are known as isolation mechanisms. The entire process is called speciation.
