There are two main forms of isolating mechanism that lead to the formation of new species (speciation).

The first of these is geographical isolation. Geographical isolation occurs through the physical separation of one or more demes. This separation can take the form of a river forming or an earthquake - any physical feature that would prevents members of the same species from interbreeding. This form of speciation is known as allopatric speciation and is very likely to give rise to a new species. A new species is said to have formed if the two populations have established a separate gene pool and can no longer interbred.

The second form of isolating mechanism is reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation itself can be further broken down into further more specific mechanisms: behavioural, mechanical, gametic, unviability and sterility. Reproductive isolation is caused when organisms which are inhabiting the same environment become separated into two groups even though there are no physical barriers to their reproduction. This form of species formation is known as sympatric speciation and occurs between demes in the same geographic area.

Behavioural isolation is the mechanism that occurs in animals with elaborate mating rituals or courtship behaviour. The isolation occurs because the steps in one subspecies ritual fails to elicit and required response in a member of the other subspecies who is the potential partner.

Gametic isolation occurs in flowering plants and animals. In plants it is where pollination is prevented from occurring because the pollen grain does not germinate on the stigma. In animals sperm may fail to survive long enough for fertilisation to occur.

Mechanical isolation is simple that the genitalia of two subspecies is incompatible.

Unviability and sterility refer to properties of Hybrids. Hybrids are animals like the 'liger' or the 'zebronky'. Hybrid unviability occurs when even though fertilisation has taken place the embryo does not develop. Often hybird unviability occurs because chromosomes no longer match each other for example having some chromosomes with different sizes or gene loci. This is the case in polyploidy.

Sterility on the other hand is caused because the sets of chromosomes in the offspring of the inter-species breeding can not pair up during meiosis because the sets of chromosomes from each parent are different. It results in offspring which cannot produce gametes - making the individual sterile.
