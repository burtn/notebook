There are two types of variation. Discontinuous variation and continuous variation. Both types of variation can be caused in one of two ways depending on the manner in which the organism reproduces. Organisms which reproduce asexually such as bacteria, some plants and fungi can only gain variety in their population through mutations. Sexually reproducing organisms however gain variation through meiosis and fusion of gametes alongside mutations.

Continuous variation is where the variation occurs over a range of values. Examples of continuous variation include height or shoe size. Discontinuous variation on the other hand is variation in characteristics which are clear cut and controlled by a single gene. e.g. blood group (the ABO system) and other genes in which there are more than two alleles.

Variation also arises in two ways. Heritable variation is variation that arises from genetic changes. This variation is produced through three processes.

- Cross fertilisation: when two parental genotypes are mixed.
- Crossing over: The exchange of genes between homologous chromosomes during prophase one of meiosis.
- Random distribution: the random manner in which chromosomes are distributed through metaphase one of meiosis.

Most often the changes that occur through these processes create a new combination of alleles in only a single generation. This is in contrast to mutations which often create long lasting variations. The problem with mutations is that the majority of mutations that occur are not useful.

This is also true for Non-heritable variation which is variation arising from environmental factors. An organisms environment dictates things like diet, light sources and availability of nutrients. These determine the phenotypic variation of the organism. That is the characteristics are shown in the organism. Consider that you inherit a number of genes from your parents which determine how tall you'll grow. You may not reach that height if you do not get appropriate nutrients. This is variation caused by your environment and is primarily the cause of continuous variation in a population.
