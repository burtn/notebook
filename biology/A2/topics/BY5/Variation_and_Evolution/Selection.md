The theory of natural selection is credited to Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who proposed the theory after visiting the Galapagos Islands in 1832 as part of a scientific survey. The islands were particularly good for observing variation in populations because they were originally volcanic. Because of this when they formed there was no life present on them. This meant Darwin could conclude that all the plants and animals that were living on the island at the time must have flown or arrived by see from the mainland (the Galapagos are situated 600 miles off Ecuador, South America).

The theory of natural selection proposed that organisms which are adapted better to their environment relative to other members are more likely to survive long enough to produce offspring the are successful. The theory is based on observations that Darwin made, variation occurs in any population and individuals in a population can produce large numbers of offspring yet population size remains roughly constant. Based on this it can be suggested that 'there is competition for resources', 'only the fittest members of a population survive' and 'individuals which survive have a selective advantage (they have the characteristics that allow them to succeed)'.

Natural selection is a continuous process in that as environmental conditions vary the characteristics needed to survive also change.
