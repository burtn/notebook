Crossing over in meiosis is a key feature which makes it different from mitosis. Homologous chromosomes form pairs called bivalents. A bivalent consists of four strands made up of two chromosomes. These split into two chromatids which wrap around and then partially repel each other - remaining joined only at the chiasmata. At these chiasmata chromatids can break and later recombine with different but still equivalent chromatids.
