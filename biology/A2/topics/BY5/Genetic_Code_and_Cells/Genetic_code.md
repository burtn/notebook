A DNA molecule can be further subdivided into genes. A gene consists of a certain length of DNA on a chromosome which codes for the production of a particular polypeptide in the process of protein synthesis. These genes make up the genetic code of a cell. These are carried in DNA across generations of the same cell. This code determines what reactions can take place in the cell and therefore in the entire organism. Genes code of polypeptides which are built into proteins like enzymes. These enzymes determine the characteristics of an organism. These characteristics are the phenotype of the organism.
Each polypeptide code is a 'triplet code'. That is each polypeptide is coded for by 3 bases on a DNA strand. A DNA molecule has four different nitrogenous bases. These are: adenine, guanin, cytosine and thymine. If only one base was used per amino acid there would only be 4 (one for each base), if two were used there would be 16 amino acids in total. However there are over 20 amino acids coded for by the triplet code. Some of the codes however are actually STOP and START codons whcih signal to the ribosome when to stop building a protein. A codon is a set of three bases. Each codon is always read seperately and do not overlap.
These codons are not just the ones used in humans, they are exactly the same in every single living organism.
