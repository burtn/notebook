DNA is the fundamental start of protein synthesis; acting as a template to create a protein out of its constituent amino acids. Whilst the DNA molecule never leaves the nucleus itself one strand is used to form mRNA (messenger RNA) in transcription. It is this molecule which leaves the nuclues through the nuclear pores and enters the cytoplasm where it is used by a number of ribosomes to build proteins. This build process is translation and uses complementary (to the mRNA strand) tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules to chain together linked amino acids into a polypeptide chain.
After translation has occured this tRNA is released from its bound amino acid (which is now in the polypeptide chain) and can collect more amino acids from the cells amino acid 'pool'. This collection of amino acids is called activation and requires ATP to provide the energy the allows the amino acid to be attached to the tRNA.
