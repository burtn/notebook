Meiosis is important for sexual reproduction because it produces variation but also haploid cells. Having 
haploid cells is important because it means that when two gametes fuse at fertilisation the resulting cell (the zygote) is diploid and so has the correct number of chromosomes. Genetic variation is equally important. The two events responsible for introducing variation during meiosis are crossing over between the chromatids of homologous pairs of chromosomes and independent assortment.
Fertilisation also introduces variation due to the random fusing of gametes. All of these sources of 
variation aid in a species survival and provide the ability of a species to colonise a new environment.
The variety is produced many different ways. The first is that the chromosomes making up a homologous pair carry different genetic material so that during sexual reproduction when the haploid gametes fuse the genotype (genetic code) of the mother and father mix. Arrangement along the spindle in metaphase 1 also adds variation when they separate independently producing daughter cells with a different combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes.
The final way that variation can be introduced is crossing over in chiasmata formation (prophase 1) this allows equivalent genes on homologous pairs to be exchanged to make new combinations as well as separate genes that may be linked. This final method is called recombination.
