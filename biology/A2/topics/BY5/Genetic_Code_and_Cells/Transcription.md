Transcription is the first step in protein synthesis and is the process of building the mRNA strand which will eventually leave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm (the location of protein synthesis).
First the enzyme helicase acts on a particular part of the DNA called the cistron. In doing so the helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases and causes the newly seperated DNA to move apart. This make the bases in that section of DNA availiable to another enzyme - RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase binds to the exposed template strand of the DNA at the start point of the to be copied sequence. Free RNA nucleotides then align themselves with the template strand. The free RNA nucleotides align to complement the DNA strand e.g. ctyosine -> guanin, thymine -> adenine and adednine whih in RNA binds with uracil which is not present in DNA.
RNA polymerase then travels down the DNA strand bonding together the RNA nucleotides into a molecule of mRNA. Just behind the travelling RNA polymerase molecule the DNA winds back up again.
Once the mRNA has been synthesised it then leaves the nucleas through a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm and attaches to one or more ribosomes which consist of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and protein.
