- DNA can be copied through a process known as semi-conservative replication.
- Meiosis is the process of cell division in sex cells.
- Meiosis results in the formation of haploid gametes.
- Meiosis produced gametes which are genetically different.
- Meiosis has two divisions.
- Crossing over and random segregation results in variation.
- DNA also acts as a template strand for mRNA.
- mRNA is messenger RNA and is used for protein synthesis.
- mRNA carries information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
- Ribosomes are where proteins are synthesised.
