- Variation occurs as a result of environmental factors and genetic changes.
- A genetic mutation occurs when a change in the DNA base sequence is made.
- A mutation is unpredictable.
- A chromosome mutation occurs because of modifications in chromosome structure.
- Chromosome mutations can also occur because of changes in the number of individual or whole sets of chromosomes.
- Natural selection suggests that organisms which are best adapted to survive reproduce to pass on their genes.
- The genes passed on by successful organisms contain beneficial characteristics for the next generation.
- Organisms which reproduce through sexual reproduction have lots of genetic variation.
- The amount of genetic variation in a group of organisms is known as the gene pool.
- If two populations become split and isolated from each other a new species may be formed.
- Isolation can occur because of geographical mechanisms or reproductive mechanisms.
