- An ecosystem consists of the living/biotic and non-living/abiotic inhabitants of an area and their interactions.
- Ecological energetics is the study of energy flow through different ecosystems.
- Energy passes between trophic levels, moving higher up the energy pyramid each time.
- The energy passes results in energy loss as a result of excretion and respiration.
- Photosynthesis has a low efficiency.
- Energy pyramids are one of the diagrams (and the most accurate) used in representing food chains/feeding relationships.
- Succession is the change of a community over time in terms of its composition and structure.
