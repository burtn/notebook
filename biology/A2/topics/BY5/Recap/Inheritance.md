- A monohybrid cross is the study of the inheritance of one single gene.
- Dihybrid crosses show inheritance of two seperate genes.
- In meiosis only one of a pair of alleles enters a gamete.
- dihybrid inheritance involves a either of a pair of alleles combning randomly with either of another pair.
- Co-domminance is where heterozygote individuals have a phenotype that is intermediate between two homozygous parents.
- Genes that are present on the same chromosome are linked and inherited together.
- Genes carried out the same sex chromosome are sex linked.
