- A monohybrid cross is the study of the inheritance of one single gene.
- Dihybrid crosses show inheritance of two separate genes.
- In meiosis only one of a pair of alleles enters a gamete.
- Dihybrid inheritance involves either of a pair of alleles combining randomly with either of another pair.
- Co-dominance is where heterozygote individuals have a phenotype that is intermediate between two homozygous parents.
- Genes present on the same chromosome are linked and inherited together.
- Genes carried on the same sex chromosome are sex linked.
