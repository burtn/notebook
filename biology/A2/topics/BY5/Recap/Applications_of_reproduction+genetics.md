- Cloning can be used to produce genetically identical organisms.
- Cloning can produce large numbers of oraganisms, quickly.
- Micropropagation provides a rapid method for producing lots of genetically identical plants.
- Artificial clones can be formed in animals by seperating embryos.
- Growing cells in a lab is known as tissue culture.
- Stem cells are important in tissue engineering.
- Therapeutic stem cell cloning has large medical potential.
- Stem cells raise ethical issues.
- The human genome project has determined the order of the bases in the human genome.
- The human genome project has also identified, sequenced and mapped all the bases in the human genome.
- Genetic engineering takes genes from one organism and transfers them into another host organism.
- Recombinant DNA technology involves the introduction of DNA from various organisms into bacteria.
- Bacteria can be used in genetic engineering to produce a desired product.
- A transgenic/genetically modified organism has its genotype altered.
- A transgenic or GM organism produces a new strain of organism.
- GM Organisms have lots of potential in agriculture (crops) and health.
- Gene therapy aims to treat genetic diseases.
- Gene therapy replaces defective genes in a patients body with those which function correctly.
- A reaction called the polymerase chain reaction can produce large amounts of identical DNA from a small sample.
- A persons genetic fingerprint (DNA profile) is unique to them.
- DNA fingerprinting can be used sd forensic evidence.
- DNA fingerprinting can also determine parents in paternity cases.
