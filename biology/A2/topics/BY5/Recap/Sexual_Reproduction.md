- In sexual reproduction haploid gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote.
- For humans spermatozoa are produced in the testes. (Male)
- For humans ova are produced in the ovaries. (Female)
- Spermatogenisis is the process that produces sperm.
- Oogenisis is the production of the secondary oocyte.
- Fertilisation can only occur after capacitation.
- Two main methods of polination for folowering plants, wind or insect.
- Cross-polintation allows for far greater genetic variation in a population of plants.
- Self-pollination results in little genetic variation.
- Flowering plants carry out double fertilisation, they are unique in this aspect.
- The seed produced by flowering plants is enclosed within the ovary.
- The seed contains the zygote.
- The seed develops into the embryo and food store.
- The food store contained within the seed is known as the endosperm.
