Herbivores such as sheep and other grazing animals eat a large amount of plant material i.e. producers but not all of it. For example the sheep may eat a lot of grass but will not eat the roots of the grasses. Some of this material is eaten by other herbivores but often it 'goes to waste'. As a result consumers have a efficiency of approximately 10% - eating 10 grams of food nets them a mere gram. This coupled with the fact that some herbivores like cows are unable to digest cellulose (they lack the correct enzymes) effectively this means that only some of the net primary productivity is in fact transferred to primary consumers. However the energy from undigested cellulose is not lost since it is made availiable to decomposers through the faeces of the animal. In all herbivores are less efficient than carnivores. This is because carnivores lose only 20% of their energy intake through excretion. Carnivores also have a higher Secondary productivity due to their easily digestible diet which is rich in protein. This means that 2 times the amount of energy per unit mass of food is taken in by carnivores compared with herbivores.
