A Community is the different populations of species which can be found living in a habitat. Since Ecosystems are dynamic they don't remain the same indefinitely. When the environment changes it has a direct impact on the organims which inhabit it. Likewise, if an organism changes it too impacts on the environment.

When a group of organisms colonise a new environment they are referred to as a pioneer comunity. The pioneer comunity (in fact any comunity) can consist of both animals as well as plants. These first plants and animals are pioneer species lay the grounwork for further successions, that is changes in the structure and compostion of the comunity as time goes on. Eventually a climax comunity is formed. A climax comunity is one which has reached an equilibreum point in relation to its environment. There are no further changes in a climax comunity so the comunity is said to be stable. For this reason the comunity usually consists of long lived plants and animals.

During the development of the climax community Human activity may have a direct or indirect impact on the sucession which can in some cases prevent the natural development of the climax community. e.g. Controlled burning, Farming, Soil erosion & deforestation.
