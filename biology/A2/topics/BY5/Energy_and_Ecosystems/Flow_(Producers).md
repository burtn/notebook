The energy that is provided by producers to animals higher up in the food chain comes from the photons of light from the sun. Producers cannot absorb all of the suns energy however and a large amount is unabsorbed either because it is reflected or because it misses chlorophyll or just doesn't hit the plants leaves at all.

The energy that the producer does capture from the sun is called the gross primary productivity. This GPP refers to the rate at which the products from photosynthesis are formed. A significant amount of gross production is used up. Such as glucose in respiration. What is left over after this is referred to as net primary productivity. Primary consumers can obtain the energy that is represented by the NPP. Consumers also have a name for the rate at which their celss and tissues 'build up' energy - it is called Secondary productivity.
