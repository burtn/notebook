Like the carbon cycle the nitrogen cycle is the flow of nitrogen (both organic and inorganic) through organisms and their environment. Within the cycle there is an interchange between nitrogenous compounds which are solid an gaseous atmospheric nitrogen.

Nitrogen is used within living organisms to make amino acids which in turn are built up into proteins. Nitrogen is also used to produce nucleic acids; DNA and RNA.

Since neither plants nor animals can make use of gaseous nitrogen they must get their nitrogen souce from a different compound. Plants get their nitrogen by taking in nitrates in solution through their roots. The organic nitrogen which is then produced by plants is transferred to other organisms in the food chain when the plants are are eaten by animals.

As with carbon when plants and animals die the nitrgen remains 'locked' in their bodies and so must be decomposed along with excrement in order to release the nitrogen back into the soil.

The first process in the nitrogen cycle is Putrifaction. Putrifaction is where bactera and fungi (which are decomposers) break down dead plants, animals and their excretory products into ammonium ions (which is why the process is sometimes also referred to as ammonification. Following this the amonia is converted into nitrates (though nitrites) in the process of nitrification. Examples of the involved bacteria include Nitrosomonas which converts ammonium to nitrite and Nitrobacter which converts nitrite to nitrate. Both of these conversions require aerobic conditions.

The atmospheric nitrogen can also be converted straight into nitrogen compounds through a number of Nitrogen fixation methods. One is Lightning but there is also free living bacteria like Azotobacter which account for the majority of nitrogen fixation. Another bacteria is the symbiotic Rhizobium which is found in legumes (beans, peas and clover) which provide nitrogen to the plant as well as releasing some back into the soil.

Nitrogen can also be released back into the atmosphere through denitrification whcih involves more bacteria this time in anaerobic conditions like water logged soil. Pseudomonas is one such bacteria that can reduce nitrates and ammonium (ions) back into nitrogen.

We can however improve nitrogen ciculation through our farming practices. Planing clover fields encourages nitrogen fixation while plouging feilds aerates the soil to create aerobic conditions. Similarly draining land that is water logged reduces anerobic conditions too. Farmers can also use the large amount of animal waste from the rearing of livestock as manure.

There are other ways that we can improve nitrogen too. We can fix atmospheric nitrogen ourselves using the haber process to convert it into fertiliser. More microorganisms can also be used for making compost and finally sewage disposal increases the supply of organic nitrogen.
