The photons of light from the light source (more often than not - the sun) are said to be
'harvested'. This harvesting is performed by photosystems of which there are two - photosystem one
and photosystem two. These are sometimes referred to as PS700 and PS680 respectively. The numbers
refer to the peak absorption wavelength of each photosystem. Both photosystems are formed around a
molecule of chlorophyll a which is the reaction centre of the photosystem, surrounding the
chlorophyll in a 'funnel' are the accessory pigments clustered together in groups of many hundred
molecules in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. These groups are refered to as antenna
complexes. Associated with each pigment is a protein which aids in the 'funneling' of the photons in
the chloroplast. In this way the pigments pass the absorped energy from one molecule to the next
through the antenna complex until it reaches the reaction centre - a molecule of chlorophll a.
