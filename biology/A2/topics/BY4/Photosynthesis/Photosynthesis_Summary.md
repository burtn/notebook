Photosynthesis provides energy for plants. This is done by converting light energy usually in the
form on sunlight and converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP.

There are two stages to photosynthesis, the light dependant and light independant phases. We know
that photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of green leaves because of an experiment carried
out by a biologist called Engelmann in 1887. The experiment that Engelmann carried out was to discover
which wavelength of light would prove most effective in photosynthesis in gree alga.
