## Respiration

> Respiration is a series of reactions which take place withhin the cells of organisms.
> As a result of these reactions energy is released from organic molecules like glucose.

* The energy released from respiration is in the form of ATP.
* ATP is made from a molecule of ADP and Pi.
* In order to add phosphate group to a molecule (here ADP + Pi => ATP) a phosphorlylaton must take place.

The 4 stages of respiration are...

* Glycolysis
* The Link Reaction
* The Krebs Cycle
* The Electron Transport Chain

* Glycolysis is the first step of respiration.
* Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm.
* Glycolysis takes a glucose and splits it into two molcules of pyruvate.
* This process releases ATP (net gain 2) and reduced NAD (NADH).

* The link reaction follows glycolysis.
* The link reacton converts pyruvate into Acetyl CoA which enters the mitochondrion to be used in the krebs cycle.

* The krebs cycle produces ATP and Carbon Dioxide.
* It is carried out twice for each glucose molecule.
  * ... as 1 glucose = 2 pyruvate after glycolysis.
* The krebs cycle also produces reduced electron carriers - NADH and FADH.
* These carriers take electrons to the electron transport chain.

* The electron transport chain uses the energy provided by electrons to pump protons across the membrane of the mitochondrion.
* This creates an electro-chemical gradient.
* This allows ATP to be produced by ATP synthase in a process called oxidative phosphorylation.

* For each molecule of glucose 37/38 ATP molecules can be produced.
* Anaerobic respiration only produces 2 ATP molecules for each glucose.
