- Respiration is a series of reactions which take place withhin the cells of organisms.
- As a result of these reactions energy is released from organic molecules like glucose.
- The energy released has the form of ATP.
- ATP is made form a molecule of ADP and Pi.
- In order to add phosphate group to a molecule a phosphorlylaton must take place.
- Respiration consists of four stages.
-- Glycolysys
-- The Link reaction
-- The Krebs cycle 
-- The electron transport chain

- Glycolysis is the first step.
-- Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm.
-- Involves splitting glucose into pyruvate.
-- This process releases ATP (net gain 2) and reduced NAD (NADH)

- The link reaction follows glycolysis
-- The link reacton converts pyruvate into Acetyl CoA which enters the mitochondrion to be in the krebs cycle.

- The krebs cycle produces ATP and Carbon Dioxide
-- It is carried out twice for each glucose molecule.

- The krebs cycle also produces reduced electron carriers
-- These carreirs take electrons to the electron transport chain.

- The electron transport chain uses the energy provided by electrons to pump protons across the membrane of the mitochondrion.
-- It creates an electro-chemical gradient
-- This allows ATP to be produced by ATP synthase
-- This is called oxidative phosphorylation

- For each molecule of glucose 37/38 ATP molecules can be produced.
- Anaerobic respiration only produces 2 ATP molecules for each glucose.
