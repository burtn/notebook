- Photosynthesis is the process by which plants synthesise organic molecules from carbon dioxide and water using energy provided by photons.
- Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast of the plant cell.
- In the chloroplasts are photosystems.
- These consist of Photosynthetic pigments grouped together.
- These are known as antenna complexes.
- These antenna complexes funnel photons of light to the reaction centre.
- The reaction centre consists of a molecule of chlorophyll a
- The absorbption of the photons energy by the reaction centre causes two of chlorophyll a's electrons to become excited and move to a higher energy state.
- These electrons are then passed to a series of electron acceptors
- This results in the formation of ATP by photophosphorlyation (since light is used)
- This is known as the light dependant phase of photosynthesis.
- It takes place entirely in the chloroplasts thylakoid membrane.
- The products of this (ATP and NADP) are used in the light independant phase.
- The light independant phase takes place in the stroma.
- As part of this carbon dioxide is fixed to convert it into carbohydrate using the products of the light dependant phase.
- The sysnthesis of ATP occurs in both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
- Phptolysis takes place to replace lost electrons in chlorophyll.
