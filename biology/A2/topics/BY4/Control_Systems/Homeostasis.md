Homoeostasis is by definition the maintaining of a consistent environment within a (living) organism. For example blood sugar concentration, kidney function and temperature are all maintained. 

A self regulating system works on the principal of negative feedback. For any variable that needs to be controlled there is a set point which is the desired value for the variable and the one at which the system operates. This variable is monitored by a sensor which triggers when the variable deviates from the desired value. When a receptor detects a change from the normal it dispatches instructions to a co-ordinator. This co-ordinator then in turn communicates with a number of effectors which carry out processes to correct the variable. Once the corrections have been effected and the variables value is at the desired value then the sensor is informed - this causes the detector to 'reset' and the process can begin again. This is what happens in most biological control systems.
