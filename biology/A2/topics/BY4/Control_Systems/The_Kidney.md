The kidney performs two important functions. The first is the removal of nitrogenous waste from the body. There are three forms of nitrogenous waste. Urea which comes from amino acids, Uric acid which is from Nucleic acids and Creatinine from Creatine phosphate which is an energy store in muscles.

In humans it is urea that is produced. This is because the ammonia which is first produced is highly toxic so it is converted to urea which is less toxic and also soluble in water so we can remove it in our urine. If we have too much protein in our diet the excess has to be broken down as we cannot store them. This happens in the liver where the amino acids which make up proteins are deamminated - removing their amine group. This forms ammonia which is quickly converted to urea so it can be removed.

The urea is produced by reacting deamminated amino acids with oxygen to produce ammonia which is added to carbon dioxide to crate urea. The other product of this process is Keyto acid which is converted into pyruvic acid (pyruvate) for use in respiration or is converted into fat for storage.

Unlike us birds produce thick urine made up of uric acid which is more complex than urea and therefore takes more energy to produce - it is also less toxic. Birds produce 'solid' urine because they carry very little water at it is heavy.

We have two kidneys which filter waste products from the blood. Both kidneys are made up of approximately one million uriniferous tubules which called nephrons. Each nephron contains a Bowman's capsule within which is a number of capillaries known collectively as the glomerulus. Blood is supplied to the nephron through the afferent arteriole, from the glomerulus the blood is taken by the efferent arteriole to two other separate capillary systems.

These capillary networks are the one which runs along beside the loop of Henle called the vasa recta and the capillary network serving the the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.
