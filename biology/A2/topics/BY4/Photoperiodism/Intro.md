Plants do not have a nervous system, as a result of this plants responses to stimuli are slow.
Plants use chemicals which are similar to hormones to respond to the changes in their environment.
One response is photoperiodism. Photoperiodism is response that triggeres the flowering process in
some plants based on the length of night compared to daylight.
