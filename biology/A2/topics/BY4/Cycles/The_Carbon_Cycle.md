The carbon cycle is the flow of carbon through living organisms and the environment.

Carbon dioxide is added to the air by the respiration of animals, micro-organisms and plants and naturally the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.

For plants however the process of photosynthesis uses up a large amount (almost all) of the carbon dioxide that is released by the plant into the atmosphere. Plants use carbon for the production of carbohydrates, fats and proteins which contributes to plant growth and therefore animal growth as we move up the food chain.

When plants and animals die their dead 'bodies' are acted on by saprobionts. Saprobionts are micro-organisms which obtain their food from the decaying remains of other organisms. These are found in the soil and release carbon dioxide as a gas back into the atmosphere.

For a long time the level of carbon dioxide globally in the atmosphere has risen. This is mainly because of human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation which removes a large number of photosynthesising species so less carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere.
