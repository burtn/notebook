No matter how large the stimulus the impulse that travels along the nerve always remains the same size. To judge how large a stimulus is (e.g. temperature) the frequency of the generated action potentials should be counted instead. Strong stimuli produce high frequency action potentials whist weak stimuli produce very few action potentials. It may even be that the stimulus is so weak that it doesn't initiate an action potential in the first place.

Once the action potential is generated it travels along the nerve, the speed at which it does this depends on two factors. The first is the axons diameter. If the axon has a large diameter the speed of the transmission will be larger whilst smaller axons reduce the speed of the impulse. Squid have large axons (thought to be needed for rapid escape from predators) that are visible to the human eye and are therefore useful for experiments. The other factor affecting nerve transmission speed is Myelination. Myelin insulates the axon of the nerve cell so that action potentials can not occur in the myelinated portions of the nerve, only at the nodes of Ranvier. The result of this myelination is that the impulse only has to travel a short distance, skipping out the myelinated sections of the axon - a process called saltatory conduction.
