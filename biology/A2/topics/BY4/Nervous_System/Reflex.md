A reflex is an involuntary response to a stimulus. Involuntary responses such as moving away
from a hot surface are involuntary as the brain is not involved in the process.

A reflex is a series of events which form a 'reflex arc'. A reflex arc consists of a stimulus -
the event which causes the response e.g. walking into a door. This event is detected by receptors
which in the case of walking into a door are a number of pain receptors. The receptors are linked
with sensory neurones which send signals to the spinal cord where a relay neurone joins it to a 
motor neurone which, in turn sends impulses to effectors such as muscles or glands eventually
causing a response.

Lots of day-to-day actions are reflex actions since they are done without thinking. Swallowing and
blinking are examples but there are a large number of reflexes which serve to protect us such e.g.
by preventing (skin) burning on a hot surface. 

Although the brain is not normally involved in reflexes it can become involved and can modify the
usual response. The brain does this through inhibitory nerve fibres and usually when it has extra
'data' available to it - such as a sound. So that the brain can intervene in reflexes the
impulses that create them can also travel to the brain through ascending nerve fibres that
originate in the spinal cord's grey matter.
