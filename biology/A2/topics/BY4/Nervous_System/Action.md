The action potential is the change in the axon membranes potential difference that occurs when a nerve impulses is transmitted over that section of the membrane. When a nervous impulse begins the resting potential of the membrane changes. These changes are caused by changes in the permeability of the membrane to sodium ions which results in changes in the potential difference across the membrane - depolarising the membrane and starting an action potential. Action potentials last for approximately 3 milliseconds where the membrane is depolarised. The change in charge on the inside of the membrane is as large as from -70 mV to +40 mV. After the action potential has passed the membrane is returned to its resting potential i.e. it is re-polarised. The repolarisation is caused by the outward diffusion of potassium ions, initially too many potassium ions diffuse out but this is balanced out by the sodium/potassium pumps. Whilst this is occurring the membrane can not respond to another action potential so the frequency of the nerve impulse is limited as is its direction. The time delay is known as the refactory period.
