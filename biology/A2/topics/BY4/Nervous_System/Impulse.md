A nerve impulse consists of a minute electric charege of around 50 millivolts. Nerve impulses can
be measured from the nerve using microelectrodes connected to a standard oscilloscope, this allows
measurements to be taken of transmission speed and also to allow us to look at impulse patterns in
nervous systems. It is the neurones which transmit the electrical impulses around an animal. 
Neurones do this by sending the electrical impulse along the membrane of the cell surface which
covers the axon.

When nerves are not transmiiting signals they are resting but are prepared to send a signal all
of the time. This is done through the generation of resting potentials. When an axon is resting
its inside is negative compared with the outside. This difference in charge occurs from the result
of actively transporting sodium ions and potassium ions across the membrane. This process requires
ATP as the ions are moving against a concentration gradient. Because of the need for ATP and
therefore oxygen, respiratory inhibitors and suffocation can damage the nervous system, 
particularly the brain. The sodium and potassium ions are both pumped across the membrane by
proteins called sodium-potassium exchange pumps. The pumps work continuousy in order to maintain
the concentration of ions across the membrane.

The sodium ions are pumped out at an increased rate compared with the speed that the potassium
ions are pumped in. Though both ions are positive the potassium ions diffuse out faster than the
sodium ions diffuse in which creates a slight negative change inside the membrane because of the
outward flow of positively charged potassium ions.

This process polarises the membrane because the net result is that the outside becomes slightly
positive and the inside slightly negative.
