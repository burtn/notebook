The term Hydra refers to the genus of simple (and small) fresh-water dwelling animals which have
radial symmetry. Radial symmetry is the property that an organisms has no left or right side - just
a top and bottom. 

Since hydra are 'simple' (though complicated in that they show morphallaxis and not senescence
- they can regenerate and appear not to age) they do not have as many receptors and effectors as
humans do. In general human senses are complex and require varying responses from different organs.
Hydra on the other hand lack proper muscles and a brain. For this reason the nervous system of 
hydra is referred to as a nerve net. This nerve net is made up of nerve cells with short
extensions joining them together and connecting touch sensitive cells in the body wall and
tentacles as well as photoreceptors.

The resulting system results in very slow nerve impulse transmission.
