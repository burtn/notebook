Neurones are specialised cells designed to generate and then transmit action potentials (impulses)
which consist of an electrical charge. In all there are three types of neurone. Sensory neurones
- these carry impulses from the sensory organ to the central nervous system. Connecting neurones or
relay neurones which receive the nerve impulses from the sensory neurones or intermediate neurones
and passes the impulse to other relay neurones or to motor neurones. Motor neurones carry the
nerve impulse from the central nervous system to the effector organ which is either a gland or
a muscle.

All of the different neurone types are made up of a cell body, dendrites and axons. The cell body
like most cells has a nucleus and a cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of a neurone has lots of ribosomes
within it - they are groped together into Nissl granules which work to form neurotransmitter
substances. Dendrites are short extensions which carry the impulse towards the cell body. Axons
on the other hand carry impulses away from the cell body and are long, often myelinated extensions
of the cytoplasm. The end of an axon is branched to form synapses with other neurones. Axons
are surrounded by Schwann cells which produce myelin (a lipid) which protects the axon and
insulates it - hence they are referred to as myelinated. This myelin sheath is multilayered and
speeds up the transmission of nervous impulses - it has at intervals a thin area called a node of
ranvier which also assists in the transmission of impulses. The myelin sheath is only found in the
nervous system of vertebrates.
