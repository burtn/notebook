ATP is involved in a variety of biological processes from movement through muscle contraction to the
synthesis of materials needed by cells. It useful for creating large and complex molecules from
much smaller and far simpler ones. For example ATP is used in the synthesis of polypeptides from
amino acids and DNA from nucleotides. ATP is also used in active transport because it requires
energy to move molecules up or against a concentration gradient. Specifically to change the shape of
carrier proteins in the cells plasma membrane. Cells also use ATP for secretion - the ATP is used
for the packaging of secretory products into vesicles. But ATP is also used in larger more complex
systems than just single cells. It is also involved in Nerve transmission, powering
sodium-potassium pumps which actively transport potassium ions across the plasma membrane.
