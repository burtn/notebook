If the body released energy from glucose in a manner which was not controlled then it would cause
cell death. This is because the uncontrolled increase in temperature leads to an increase in
temperature which destroys cells.

To overcome this issue organisms use gradual energy release in order to produce ATP. To do this ADP
is converted to ATP by the addition of a phosphate molecule. This process also uses up energy so the
reaction is referred to as endergonic. The amount of energy needed to add a phosphate molecule to ADP
is 30 kJ per mol, these phosphate groups are held together by high energy bonds.

Reversing this process is what releases energy - the ATP can be hydrolysed into ADP and phosphate in
an exergonic reaction as energy is released. The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP is catalysed by the
enzyme ATP-ase. Removing the phosphate group releases the same amount of (free) energy as was
stored, 30 kJ per mol. When the additional phosphate is removed it can be transferred to another
molecule making it more reactive and therefore lowering the activation energy of the new molecule.

Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group. Here it is ADP that is phosphorylated into
ATP. In all there are three forms of phosphorylation:

- Oxidative Phosphorylation - Substrate-level phosphorylation - Photophosphorylation


Oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the membranes of mitochondria in aerobic respiration. This
process also involves electron transport.

Photophosphorylation occurs on the membranes of chloroplasts since it is the type of phosphorylation
that occurs in plants. Photophosphorylation is a part of photosynthesis.

Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs when the phosphate groups are taken from 'donor' molecules and
transferred onto ADP to make ATP.
