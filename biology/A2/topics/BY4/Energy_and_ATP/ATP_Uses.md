In using ATP as an intermediary between glucose and energy organisms benefit from several
advantages.

- ATP Releases energy in small amounts when and where they are needed, conversely glucose contains
large amounts of energy that are most likely not required immediately - this also prevents cell
destruction from the excess heat that the energy in glucose would produce.

- ATP provides a common source of energy of a wide range of biological processes and chemical
reactions. This is why it is sometimes referred to as the universal energy currency. Using ATP this
way increases efficiency and give more control to the cell.

- To release energy from glucose a large number of enzymes are needed, this is not the case with ATP
for which only one enzyme is required.
