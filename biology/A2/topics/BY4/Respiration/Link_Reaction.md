After glycolysis energy is still stored in the pyruvate molecules that are produced as a result of
glycolysis. This energy however can only be released in aerobic respiration and through the Krebs
cycle. To join together the Krebs cycle and glycolysis there is another reaction called Link.

In the Link reaction pyruvate diffuses from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix where it is
first decarboxylated before it is dehydrogenated. Decarboxylation is the removal of carbon dioxide
and dehydorgenation is the removal of hydrogen. The hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of
pyruvate is accpeted by NAD to form reduced NAD (NADH).

This forms a two carbon acetate which binds with coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A. It is the
Acetly CoA which enters the Krebs cycle.
