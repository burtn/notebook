In order to budget for the amount of energy you need it is important to know exactly how many ATP
molecules are produced from the breakdown of only one molecule of glucose.

In glycolysis a net total of two ATP molecules is produced. This is because two out of the maximum
four produced are resused for the initial activation of the glucose molecule. Glycolysis also
produces two reduced NAD molecules which have the potential to produce six more molecules of ATP
through aerobic respiration.

The link reaction produces six molecules of ATP

Krebs cycle produces twenty-four molecules of ATP of which two are made from substrate level
phosphorylation.

Therfore the total amount of ATP produced from just one molecule of glucose is thrity-eight.
