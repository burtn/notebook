Glycolysis is the first stage of respiration and it occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The glucose
molecule is firstly combined with two ATP molecules to form hexose phosphate. This 'activates' the
glucose and makes in more reactive. The hexose phosphate is then split into two molecules of triose
phosphate. Triose phospahte is a three carbon sugar whilst hexose phosphate is a six carbon
molecule.

Then the triose phosphate is converted into pyruvate through the removal of hydrogen. The removed
hydorgen reduced a molecule of NAD to form reduced NAD which is often written as NADH. I doing this
enough energy is released for the synthesis of four ATP molecules, this ATP is formed by substrate
level phosphorylation. However the net gain of ATP molecules as a result of Glycolysis is only two
as two ATP molecules are required at the begining of the process to atctivate glucose.

The molecules of NADH that are produced during glycolysis have the potential to produce six further
molecules of ATP provided that the conditions for aerobic respiration are maintained.
