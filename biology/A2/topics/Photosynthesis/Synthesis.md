The TP that is removed from the light indepedant phase of photoysnthesis (the calvin cycle) is
metabolised into a number of products such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids with which the
plant can make all the chemicals it needs to live. However some inorganic ions which are nutrients
needed by the plant can be a limiting factor in metabolism should they become in short supply.

Macronutrients such as magnesium, calcium and nitrogen are also required are needed in small
amounts. Micronutrients such as copper and manganese are needed in much smaller amounts.

Nitrogen is taken into the plant by the roots in the form of nitrates. These nitrates are
transported in the xylem and as amino acids in the phloem. Nitrogen is used for the synthesis of
proteins and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. If a plant has a nitrogen deficiency it shows symptoms
such as reduced growth and chlorosis. Chlorosis is the yellowing of the leaves caused by a drop in
chlorophyll production. (Chlorosis appears first in old leaves). Magnesium forms part of the
chlorophyll molecule and is absorbed as magnesium ions. All of the plants tissues require magnesium
because it also actives ATPase - it is transported as ions in the xylem. Magnesium defficiency can
also lead to chlorosis which occurs between the veins of old leaves because exisiting magnesium is
diverted towards newly formed leaves where it can be best put to use.
