White light is a mixture of different wavelengths and in photosynthesis these different wavelengths
of light are trapped by a number of different pigments. There are two main types of pigments in
angiosperms (flowering plants). They are chlorophylls and carotenoids - the chlorophylls absorb
light which is primarilly in the in the red end of the spectrum whilst carotenoids absorb
wavelengths which are primarily in the blue end of the spectrum.

The carotenoid group can be split into a further two pigments, carotenes and xanthophylls. These act
as accessory pigments as opposed to primary pigments such as chlorophyll a.
