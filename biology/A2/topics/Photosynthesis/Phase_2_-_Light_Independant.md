The light independant phase of photosynthesis makes used of the products from the light dependant phase - ATP and NADP. It occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and involves 
a series of enzyme catalysed reactions which use ATP as a source of energy and NADP to reduce carbon dioxide in order to synthesise hexose sugar. 

The light indpendant stage of photosynthesis is often referred to as the calvin cycle and was discovered by a scientist called Calvin and his associates Benson and Bassham 
using radioactive carbon 14 and the alga Chlorella. The cycle starts with a five carbon molecule called RuBP which acts as an acceptor molecule combining with carbon dioxide 
to form an unstable six carbon compound in a reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCo. Because this six carbon compound is unstable it splits immediately into two 
molecules of GP. This molecule of GP is the phosphorylated by ATP and reduced by NADP into triose phosphate (TP). Some of the TP can be removed from the cycle and built into 
glucose phosphate and starch by condensation. However in order for the cycle to continue some of the TP must be reused. This is done by regnerating RuBP from the TP through 
a series of ATP powered reactions. The NADP is also remade and returns to the light dependant phase so that it can be reduced, and the reused again.
