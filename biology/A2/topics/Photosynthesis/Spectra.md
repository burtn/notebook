The important photosynthesis spectra are the absorption spectrum and the action spectrum. Both graphs are usually drawn together for easy comparison.

It can be shown that the different photosynthetic pigments absorb different wavelengths by preparing various pigment solutions and shining a light on them. The absorption 
spectrum is a graph that indicates how much light a given pigment absorbs in this situation. For example the graph shows that chlorophyll absorbs light at the red end of the 
spectrum - this can be seen on the graph by the peak at the end furthest from the y-axis. Similarly plotting the absorption spectrum for the other pigments produces a number 
of graphs with peaks at different points along the spectrum. Though this is useful for determining what wavelengths are being absorbed and by which pigments the data can not 
be used to determine if a particular light wavelength is actually used in the process of photosynthesis. A more useful graph for this purpose is the action spectrum. The 
action spectrum graph shows the rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light. More specifically it could be said that it shows the amount of carbohydrate that is 
produced by the plant when it is exposed to a given wavelength of light. Since carbohydrates are an eventual product of photosynthesis it can be used to determine which 
wavelenghts of light are in fact used in photosynthesis.

The two graphs are easily compared as they are usually drawn together, if you were to compare the two it would show a correlation between the absorption and action spectra 
which gives the conclusion that the pigments are responsible for absorbing the wavelenghts of light used in photosynthesis.

Note: It's probably better to say that the pigments absorb light 'energy' that absorb light. They actually absorb photons which are packets of light.
