The acetyl CoA from glycolysis enters the Krebs cycle by combining with the four carbon acid RuBP to form a six carbon compound. As a result of this reaction the CoA is 
regenerated so that it can be used again (binding with acetate in the link reaction). This six carbon compound which is produced goes through a series of reactions during 
which carbond dioxide is removed (via decarboxylation) and hydrogen is removed (via dehydrogenation). As a result of the acetate fragment breaking down a four carbon 
molecule is left over which is converted in order to regenerate the original four carbon RuBP which combines with more acetyl CoA to keep the kerbs cycle going.

Two steps in the cycle involve decarboxylation whislt their are a total of four stages which involve the dehydrogenation of a molecule. The hydrogens which are produced are 
'collected' by molecules of NAD to form three molecules of reduced NAD and also by FAD to form only one molecule of reduced FAD.

Altough there are a large number of steps in the krebs cycle the final amount of ATP produced in one loop of the cycle is just one molecule. Therefore from one pyruvate 
molecule entering the Krebs cycle the products are:

- one molecule of ATP
- one molecule of reduced FAD
- three molecules of reduced NAD

Note though that two pyruvate molecules are produced as a result of glycolysis so in fact two ATP molecules of ATP are produced from glycolysis products. Because two 
molecules of pyruvate (and therefore two molecules of acetyl CoA) enter the cycle it is carried out twice for every one molecule of glucose.

The krebs cycle only produces one molecule of reduced FAD becuase there is only one place where FAD acts as a carrier molecule.

The purpose of the Krebs cycle is to allow access to the energy stored in the carbon bonds so that ATP and reduced NAD as well as reduced FAD can be formed. Thise carrier 
molecules (NAD and FAD) transport hydrogen to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they act as triggers for the start of the elctron 
transport process. As a result of breaking the carbon bonds carbon dioxide is released from the system from decarboxlylation.
