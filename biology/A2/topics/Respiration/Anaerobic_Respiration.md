Anaerobic respiration is the the process of respiration that occurs in conditions where there is an
absence of oxygen. Because of the absence of oxygen only glycolysis can take place. Both the link
reaction and the Krebs cycle can not be carried out this is because the reduced NAD and FAD cannot
be oxidised again - this means that they cannot pick up more hydrogen. Because of this the amount of
ATP produced from one molecule of glucose falls all the way from thirty-eight to just two.

The anaerobic respiration which leads to the production of ethanol occurs in some microorganisms and
also some higher plants such as watter logged root cells. The anaerobic repiration whcih leads to
the production of lactic acid occurs primarily in muscle tissue and is the resilt of heavy
excersize.

The first of these anaerbic conditions is useful, it takes place in yeast to produce alcohol and
carbon dioxide. This process is a fermenation. After glycolysis the pyruvate produced is
decarboxylated (producing carbon dioxide) into ethanal. NAD still accepts the hydrogen released
during glycolysis it is then transferred to the enthanal which causes it to be reduced into ethanol
(also known as alchohol).

The second aerobic condition produces lactic acid in muscle tissue. The second condition occurs when
not enough oxygen can reach muscle cells, this prevents them from producing the ATP they need by
aerobic respiration so they can only use the ATP produced by glycolysis. The reduced NAD from
glycolysis in this situation gives up its hydrogen atom to the pyruvate which causes it to reduced
into lactate - which is lactic acid. It is this lactic acid which causes muslcel cramps. At the
point where aerboic respiration can start again the lactic acid will be broken down by the liver and
converted into glycogen as an energy store for future use.
