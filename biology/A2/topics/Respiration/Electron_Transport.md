Electron tranport involves the transportation of electrons through a series of pumps and carriers which releases energy as an ATP molecule. The hydrogen atoms bound to 
reduced NAD and FAD are used in the electron transport chain. NAD and FAD are in fact coenzymes. It is the electrons in the hydrogen atoms that are the source of energy. 

In the electron transport chain is the initial acceptor then for every two hydrogen atoms that are brought into the system enough energy is gaineed to allow the synthesis of 
three ATP molecules to occur. When FAD is the initial acceptor only two molecules of ATP are produced this is due to there being no pump associeated with FAD so only two 
pumps out of a possible three are involved reducing the amount of ATP molecules produced to the number of pumps (two).

In order to explain the synthesis of ATP using the electron transport chain a model known as Chemiosmotic theory is used. This theory proposes that the energy for ATP 
synthesis is proviede by an electorchemical gradient of protons across a cell membrane. 

Chemiosmotic theory states that Hydrogen atoms first combine with NAD reducing it. This reduced NAD then 'donates' the elctrons of the hydrogen atoms it carries to the first 
pump in the chain. This reoxidises the NAD and releases protons into the matrix of the mitochondrion. The pump then pumps the protons into the inter membrane space. The 
electrons with a reduced energy level are then transferred by a carrier to the next pump along in the chain. This pump pumps more protons into the inter membrane space 
causing a build up of of protins there. This high concenration builds because the inner membrane of the mitochindrion is impenetrable to protons except for at certain 
points. An example of one of these points is where the ATP synthase moleculs is located. This 'channel' formed by the ATP synthase allows the protons to diffuse back into 
the matrix. It is the diffusion of protons through this channel that causes the ATP synthase to combine inorganic phosphate molecules with ADP in order to synthsise ATP. 

The last pump in the elxtron transport chain has no where to move it's electrons too so instead they are bound to oxygen which combines with some of the protons to form a 
molecule of water in a reaction catalysed by an oxidase enzyme. This means that the final electron acceptor of the entire process is oxygen, without it protons would build 
up in the matrix reducing the concentration gradient between the matrix and the inter membrane space until the concentraion gradient become no existent at which point no ATP 
would be produced.

This complete process is just phosphorylation. More specifically it is oxidative phosphorylation. It occurs on the membranes of the mitochondrion because the membranes have 
a large surface area on which the chemical reactions and processes that make up respiration can take place. It is the cristae of the mitochondrion which is lined with ATP 
synthase enzymes which actually produce the ATP.
