Sometimes a different respiratory substrate than glucose is used. Both proteins and fats can also be used as alternative respiratory substrates.

Fats are used as an energy store in many orgainisms and can also be used as a respiratory substrate when levels of carbohydates of which glucose is an example fall too low. 
In order to be used the lipid has to be split into its individual components; glycerol and three fatty acids. This is done by hydrolysis after which the glycerol is 
converted into a three carbon sugar which allows it to enter the krebs cycle through triose phosphate. The remaining fatty acid chains are long and can be broken down into a 
number of two carbon fragments which enter the respiration pathway as acetly CoA. Because the fatty acid chains can vary in length the number of ATP molecules that can be 
produced also varies.

Because it is possible to produce such a large number of ATP molecules from a lipid one gram of fat certainly releases more that two times the energy of one gram of 
carbohydrate.

It is also possible to use proteins as a respiratory substrate but only in extreme circumstances. An example of such an extreme circumstance is starvation. As a esult of 
starvation tissue protein is used to supply energy as the energy provided in the diet is too little to be useful. In digestion the protein component of food is diverted to 
be used as an alternative respiratory substrate. The protein is first converted into the amino acids that make it up through the process of hydrolysation. It then travels to 
the liver where it is deaminated, that is the amine groups of the amino acids are removed. The removed amine groups are converted into urea and excreted adn the residue is 
converted into either acetyl CoA, pyruvate of another of the krebs cycle intermediaries so that it can enter the cycle. Using protein as a respiratory substrate is generally 
a last resort when both carbohydrate and fat resources have run out.
