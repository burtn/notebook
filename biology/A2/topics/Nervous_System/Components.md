The nervous system consists of a number of components. Receptors - of which there are many
inlcuding the specialised cells found in the skin and whole organs such as the eye. These receptors
detect changes in the body or within the surounding environment. Receptors act much like
transducers since they convert one form of energy into another. At the heart of the entire system
is the central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal cord which processes the
information provided to it by the receptors and starts a response. This is done via the sending of
nerve impulses which can carry information towards or away from the central nervous system.

The actual muscle or gland which creates the change or response is reffered to as the effector.
