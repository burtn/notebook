No matter how large the stimulus the impulse that travels along the nerve always remains the same size. To judge how large a stimulus is e.g. temperature the frequency of the generated action potentials should be counted instead. Strong stimuli produce high frequency action potentials whist weak stimuli produce very few action potentials. It may even be that the stimulus is so weak that it doesn't initiate an action potential in the first place.

Once the action potential is generated it travels along the nerve, the speed at which it does this depends on two factors
