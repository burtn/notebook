Plants contain very small qunatities of a blue/green pigment phytochrome. Is is this photoreceptor
which allows plants to measure day length. There are two forms of phytochrome, both absorb light
and can be converted between the two forms. When light of a specific wavelength is absorbed each
type of phytochrome changes into the other. The two forms are phytochrome 660 and phytochrome 730.
The numbers indicate the wavelength of light each absorbs, 660nm light is red and 730nm is far red
(almost infrared) light. phytochrome 660 is often written as Pr for red light and phytochrome 730 as Pfr
for far red light. 

Pfr (phytochrome 730) is unstable and eventually changes back into Pr (phytochrome 660) this
process happens at night time because their is an absence of red light which would cause the Pr to
become Pfr. As a result of this breakdown the amount of Pr builds up. Since sunlight consists of
more red light (660 nm) than far red light (730 nm) Pfr builds up during daylight hours.

This build up of each type of pythochrome can then be compared to determine the length of the day
and trigger flowering, or not. The flowering process is thought to be started by a hormone
referred to as florigen however florigen is a hypothetical hormone so not very much is known about
it, even if it defininetly exists.

The photoperiod is measured by the leaves of a plant and then a message must be sent to the buds
which then flower.
