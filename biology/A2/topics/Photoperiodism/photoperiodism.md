In short day plants the flowering process is triggered by far red light - that is they will flower
when the levels of Pfr are sufficiently low whilst red light exposure prevents flowering from
starting. For long day plants however high levels of Pfr are the trigger for flowering. 

The whole photoperiod (which is usually a days long ie.e 24 hours) can be interupted by short dark
periods and long day plants will still flower however if the dark period is interupted by exposure
to red light flowering does not occur.
