Angiosperms (flowering plants) can be subdivided into groups based on the photoperiod which causes
them to flower. There are day neutral plants whose flowering is unaffected by day length, 
Long-day plants (or short night plants) flower when the length of night (or dark period) is
shorter than a specific length and the opposite - short day plants (or long night plants) which
begin flowering when the dark period is greater than a specific length.
