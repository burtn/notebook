- Homeostasis is the maintaining of a constant internal environment.
- Homeostatis uses negative feedback to produce an opposing change.
- The removal of metabolic waste products from the body is excretion.
- Different organisms produced different excretory products.
- The kidneys are the primary organism of the urinary system.
- Kidneys are made up of a number of nephrons.
- Within the kidneys small molecules pass are filtered from the blood through ultrafiltration.
- ultrafiltration takes place in the glomerulus.
- The product of ultrafiltration is glomerular filtrate.
- glomerular filtrate passes through the nephron and as it does so is converted to urine.
- Throughout this process substances which are needed are reabsorpbed through selective reabsorption.
- The water potential of the blood is monitored by Osmoregulators.
- The osmoregulators are located in the hypothalamus.
- The reabsorption of water is controlled by the hormone ADH.
- ADH is secreted from the pituitary gland.
