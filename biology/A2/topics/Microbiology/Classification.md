The term 'microorganism' covers a wide range of groups including fungi, Protoctists, Viriuses and
of course bacteria.

Bacteria can be classified in one of two ways either by their shape or by their reaction to the
Gram staining process. Bacteria can be one of three shapes - spherical, rod shaped or spiral shaped.
More scientifically they can either be Bacillus (rod shaped), Cocci (spherical) or Spirillum (screw)
shaped. So for example Streptococcus is spherical because it is a Cocci.

The Gram staining process divides bacteria into two groups, gram positive or gram negative. The 
difference is caused by the structure of the bacteriums cell wall. A bacteriums cell wall is
composed of polysaccarides and polypeptides known as murein or peptidoglycan. The polysaccharides
are crossed linked to give the cell wall strength and shape it also prevents the cell from bursting
(lysis) as a result of osmosis. The cell wall of bacteria which are gram negative is much more 
complex than that of gram positive bacteria. This is because the peptidoglycan is 'assisted' by 
liposaccharide molecules which protect the cell. This prevents the cell wall from retaining the
crystal violet dye and causes them to be stained by the couter-stain so that they appear red/pink
when they are viewed under a microscope. Gram positive bacteria lack the liposaccharide and so
become stained by the crystal violet. This makes them purple under the microscope!

Gram-negative bacteria are not affected by the enzyme lysozyme which is antibacterial and is a 
component of our tears. Similarly they are also resistant to penicillin, unlike gram-positive 
bacteria which are far more suceptible to antibiotics (and lysoszme).
