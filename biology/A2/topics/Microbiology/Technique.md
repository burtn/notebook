Aseptic techniques are techniques used to keep aparatus and other equipment
sterile and free from microorganisms. This prevents both the bacterial cultures
themselves and the environment from becoming contaminated.

To avoid contaminating pure cultures with other bacteria which may be found free
in the environment all aperatus and the growing media should be sterilised
before use and the cultures should be handled carefully making use of tools like
sterile loops to prevent any later contamination.

To avoid contaminating the environment with experimental bacteria the
contamination of people including yourself and the imediate environment i.e. the
rest of the Lab must be prevented through correct handling of cultures. Also
work surfaces should be sterilised before and after use with disinfectant. The
most commonly used method for sterilising equipment is an autoclave. This is a
[sealed] container into which equipment is placed before being heated to 121
degrees centigrade for 15 minutes whilst under steam pressure. This method
ensures that even bacteria such as Clostridium (a gram positive bacteria) and
other resistant endospores which are resistant to boiling are destroyed. Other
materials can also be placed in the autoclave before disposal such as petri
dishes.

Comercially however it is more likely that radiation will be used for the
sterilisation process.

Note: Endospores are internal resting cells which protect nuclear material
through unfavourable conditions such as high temperature. When better conditions
occur the endospore can form back into a bacterial cell.
