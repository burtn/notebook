Micro-ganisms are well known for their ability to reproduce quickly. In optimum conditions bacteria
can divide in two every twenty minutes. They can also be grown in the Lab on a veriety of mediums
given the right conditions.

Different micro-organisms require different conditions to grow optimally but can grow over a range
of variables. In order to grow the conditions required include:

- a suitable pH, bacteria prefer a ph or 7.4 which is slightly alakline whilst other micro-organisms
like fungi prefer slightly acidic conditions.

- a suitable temperature, growth is normally regulated by a number of enzymes which can be denatured
by high temperatures or inhibited by cold temperatures. The majority of bacteria grow in the
temperature range of 25-45 degrees centigrade whilst pathogens (desease causing micro-organisms)
have an optimum of 37 degrees centigrade which just so happens to also be our body temperature!

- Nutrients - Nitrogen, carbon (as glucose usually), vitamins and mineral salts. In a Lab setting the nutrients are
often provided by the media in/on which the bacteria are grown such as agar.

- Oxygen - Most micro-organisms are 'obligate aerobes' and require oxygen for metabolism whilst
others may grow better with oxygen but do not require it (these are 'facultative anaerobes'). Some
can not grow in Oxygen at all such as *Clostridium* bacteria which is an 'obligate anaerobe'.
*Clostridium* in fact cause the condition moist gangrene by destroying body tissue as a result of
producing toxins in a wound.
