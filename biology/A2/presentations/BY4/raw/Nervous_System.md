## Components

* Receptors - specialised cells which detect changes in the body or surrounding environment.
* Effectors - the actual muscle of gland<sup>1</sup> which creates the change or response.
* The CNS - The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord which processes impulses received by receptors and triggers a response by an effector.
---
<small><sup>1</sup>Glands which secrete hormones or other products directly into the blood are called endocrine glands.<small>

## Reflex

> A reflex is an in voluntary response in which the brain is not involved.
> <small>e.g. pulling away from a hot surface</small>

#### Reflex arc

* A reflex consists of a series of events which form a *reflec arc*.
* A reflex arc consists of...
	1. A stimulus e.g. walking into a door.
	2. Receptors e.g. pain receptors.
	3. Sensory neurons - linked to the receptors these send signals to the spinal cord.
	4. Relay neurones - joim the sensory neurones to the motor neurones in the spineal cord.
	5. effectors - a muscle or gland which causes the response.
	
* Many actions are reflex actions e.g. Swallowing, blinking.

## Reflex
#### Brain involvment

* The brain can modify a reflex response if necessary.
* This is done through inhibitory nerve fibres.
* Often occurs when the brain has more information e.g. a sound in combination with a feeling of pain.
* To allow the brain to intervene reflex impulses can also travel to the brain along ascending nerve fibres. Theses are found in the grey matter of the spinal cord.

## Nerve Nets

* In some organisms e.g. Hydra have a very simple nervous system called a nerve net.

> The term Hydra refers to the genus of 'simple', small freshwater organisms which have radial symetry<sup>1</sup>.

* Hydra do not have as many effectors and receptors as humans do.
* Hydra lack 'proper' muscles and a brain.
* The nerve net consists of nerve cells with short extensions joining them together.
* These cells connect touch sensitive cells in the body wall and tentacles as well as photoreceptors.
* The nervous impulse from these cells travels around the whole of the organism.

<strong>Nerve nets have a very slow impulse transmission speed.</strong>

<small><sup>1</sup> Radial symetry is the property that organisms have no left nor right side just a top and bottom.</small>

## Neurones

> Neurones are specialised cells designed to transmit action potentials (impulses) which consist of an electrical charge.

There are <strong>3</strong> types of neurone.

* Each neurone consists of a cell body, dendrites and axons.
* The cell body has a nuclues and cytoplasm like most other cells. A key difference however is the **large number of ribosomes present in the cells**.
	* The ribosomes are grouped into Nissi granules.
	* Nissi granules are made of **rough endoplasmic reticulum**.
	* The nissi granules work to make neurotransmitter.
	* In humans (and many other animals) the neurotranmitter is Acetylcholine.

!SLIDE

## Neurones
#### Structure

* Dendrites are short extensions which carry the nervous impulse towards the cell body.
* Axons carry impulses away from the cell body. (they are long, oft myelinated extensions of the cytoplasm.
	* Axons are surrounded by Schwann cells which wrap around the axon producing myelin (a lipid) to insulate and protect it.
	* Axons with myelin surrounding them are said to be **myelinated**.
	* The myeling sheath is multilayered and also acts to speed up nerve impulses by saltatory conduction.
	* At certain intervals in the myelin are nodes of ranvier which the impulse 'jumps between'.
	* The myelin sheath is only found in the nervous system of vertebrates.
* Axon terminals are found at the end of an axon on branches which from synapses with other neurones or muscles (see neuromuscular junction)

!SLIDE

## Neurones
#### Types

* Sensory - carries impulse from sensory organ -> CNS
* Relay - carries impulse from sensory/intermediary neuron -> more relay/motor neurones
* Motor - carry the nerve impulse from the CNS -> effector organ <small>(which is either a gland or a muscle)</small>.

!SLIDE

## Impulse

> A nerve impulse consists of a minute electric charge - approx. 50mV.

* Nerve impulses can be measured using microelectrodes + standard osciloscope.
* Nerve impulses can be timed and patterns detected.
* <strong>The electroncal impulse travels along the membrane of the axon</strong>.

!SLIDE

## Impulse
#### Resting potential

* When nerves are not transmitting signals they are 'resting'.
* Resting nerve cells can transmit a signal at any time.
* To be ready to do this the nerve generates a resting potential.
	* When an axon is resting its inside is negative compared with the outside.
	* The resting potential is generated by **actively tranporting**  sodium and potassium ions across the membrane.
		* They are pumped continuously by protiens called sodium-potassium exchange pumps.
		* Na ions are pumped out faster than K is pumped in.
		* Both ions are +ve.
		* K ions diffuse out faster then the Na ions diffuse in to create the charge.
	* ATP is used as the ions move against a concentration gradient.
		* Because ATP is needed respiratory inhibitors e.g. Cyanide can damage the nervous system. As can oxygen deprivation.
	
<strong>The resting potential polarises the membrane because of the &#x03B4;<sup>-</sup> charge inside and &#x03B4;<sup>+</sup> charge outside.</strong>

## Action Potential

> The action potential is the change in the axon membranes potential difference that occurs when a nerve impulses is transmitted over that section of the membrane.

* When a nerve impulse starts the resting potential of the membrane changes.
* The change in potential is caused by a change in permeability of the membrane to Na ions.
* As sodium ions rush in the membrane depolarises.
* Action potentials last for approximately 3 milliseconds.
* Change in charge from -70 mV to +40 mV.
* After the action potential has passed the membrane is returned to its resting potential.
	* The repolarisation (to resting potential) is caused by the outward diffusion of potassium ions.
	* Initially too many potassium ions diffuse out.
	* This is countered by pumping of Na ions out.
	* During this period, known as the *refractory period* the mebrane cannot respond to another action potential.

## Action Potential
#### The need for a refractory period.

The refractory period during which no other action potentials travel along the membrane serves to...

* Limit the frequency of nerve impulses.
* Ensure the impulse travels in the correct direction only.

!SLIDE

## Synapses

* Where neurones meet there are chemical synapses.
* The purpose of the synapse is transmit action potentials between different neurones.
* Synapses only allow the impulse to travel in one direction<sup>1</sup>.
* Synapses protect the nervous system from overstimulation<sup>2</sup>.
* Synapses filter out low level stimuli.
* The size of the synaptic cleft (gap) is approximately 20 micro meters.

	<p><sup>2</sup> ...because of the time require for the neurotransmitter Acetly Choline to be regenerated.</p>
</small>

## Synapses
#### Action

1. When the action potential reaches the synpatic Knob voltage gated calcium channels open.
2. Calcium ions enter the cell activating enzymes which move the synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter to the presynaptic membrane.
3. The neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis.
4. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the space and binds with receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.
5. These receptors causes ligand<sup>1</sup> gated channels to open.
6. Sodium ions to enter the postsynaptic membrane.
7. The influx of ions depolarises the cell, triggering the action potential.

**NB:** As in sensory neurones, the action potential is only restarted if the membrane becomes sufficiently depolarised.

## On drugs

* Some drugs can cause an increase in activity at the synapses.
* Drugs affecting the nervous system can be classified as one of two types, **excitory or inhibitory**.
	* Excitory Drugs are those which cause an increase in the number of action potentials in the postsynaptic membrane.
	* Inhibitory drugs are those which reduce the number of action potentials that occur.
* Drugs which affect the central nervous system are referred to as **Psychoactive** drugs.

## On drugs
#### Examples

* Insecticides containing organophosphate compounds (some of which are now banned in the UK and the EU) which block the neurotransmitter break-down enzyme Acetlycholinesterase this makes the neurotransmitter Acetlycholone last far longer than it would normally.
	* This can cause repeated stimulation of the nerve and if occuring at a neuromuscular junction then the muscle undergoes repeated contractions.
* Other organophosphate compounds like Sarin are used as chemical weapons because of their nerve agent properties.
* There are many psychoactive drugs and they are for the most part, illegal e.g cannabis, ecstasy, heroine and cocaine. Originally many psychoactive drugs were developed for medicinal purposes, cannabis for example.

!SLIDE

## A.O.N.

> "No matter how large the stimulus the impulse that travels along the nerve always remains the same size."
> - The All or nothing law 'A.O.N.'

* The impulse that travels along the nerve always remains the same size regardless of stimuli.
* The strength of a stimuli is given by the frequency of the nerve impulses.
* Strong stimuli produce high frequency action potentials whist weak stimuli produce very few action potentials.
* Some stimuli may not trigger an action potential.

!SLIDE

## A.O.N.
#### Transmission Speed

The speed of transmission depends on two factors:

* Axon diameter - if the axon has a large diameter the speed of the transmission will be larger whilst smaller axons reduce the speed of the impulse.
* Myelination - Myelin insulates the axon allowing action potentials to form only at the nodes of ranvier.
	* This allows the impulse to 'skip out' the myelinated sections so the overall distance travelled is less.
