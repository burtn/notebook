## Intro

* Plants do not have a nervous system.
* As a result plants respond slowly to stimuli
* To respond to changes in their environment plants use hormones.

> Photoperiodism is a response to the relative length of night and day which causes plants to flower.

## Types

* Angiosperms are the group of flowering plants.

Angio sperms can be subdivided into groups based on the photoperiod that triggers flowering in that species.

* Day neutral plants - Flowering unaffected by day length.
* Long day plants (short night plants) - Flower when dark period (night) is shorter than a critical length.
* Short day plants (long night plants) - Flower when dark period (night) is longer than a critical length.

## Phytochrome

* Phytochomre is a blue/green pigments found in very small quantities in plants.
* It is the photoreceptor that allows plants to measure day length.
* There are two froms of phytochrome Pr and Pfr.
* Pr absorbs red light of 660nm.
* Pfr absorbs far red light of 730nm.
* When Pr absorbs red light it is converted to Pfr.
* Pfr (phytochrome 730) is unstable and eventually changes back into Pr (phytochrome 660).
	* This happens at night time when there is no red light.
* The amount of each type of phytochrome can then be compared to determine the length of day (ans so night also).

## Phytochrome
#### Florigen

* It is thought that flowering is triggered by a hormone.
* This hormone is the hypothetical florigen.
* The photoperiod is measured by the leaves of a plant and then a message must be sent to the buds which then flower.
	* This implies that florigen travels in the phloem.
	* Florigen is found in all angiosperms. AWTTE.

## Photoperiodism
#### Examples

* One Photoperiod is 24 hours.
* Short day plants flower when levels of Pfr are sufficiently low.
* If the night is interupted by light exposure then the plant will not flower.
	* This is because the light converts some Pr back to Pfr making the amount of Pfr longer than the critical period.
