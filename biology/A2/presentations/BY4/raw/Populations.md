## Controlling Population Growth

> The size of a population is found from the birth rate and death rate. <small>For some organisms emmigration and immigration also affect population size.</small>

* When a species encounters an area which it can colonise it grows following the S-shaped curve.
* The S shaped is caused by the lag, log and stationary phases.
* In the lag phase there are very few individuals so growth is slow. The organisms must adapt to the environment synthesising enzymes and carrying out other metabolic activity e.g. switching on genes.
* In the log phase (with no factor limiting growth) population size increases exponentially.

> Exponential growth is growth whose rate becomes ever more rapid in proportion to the growing total number or size.

* Eventually a factor limits population growth and the population enters the stationary phase.
	* Here the number of births is equal to the number of deaths.
* The largest size population can reach in an environment is known as the carrying capacity.
*  After the stationary phase is the death phase.
	* This is when the death rate is greater than the birth rate.

## Controlling Population Growth
#### Environmenta Resistance

* The environment can also 'resist' population growth.
* This resistance includes a number of factors which affect population size such as...
	* disease,
	* the weather,
	* build up of toxic waste. 

All of these factors **slow down** poulation growth.

* Some factors may also cause the population to 'crash'.
* These are density independant factors which **affect all the organisms in an environment regardless of population size.**
* Usually caused by a sudden change in an abiotic factor
* e.g. wildfire

* Other factors are those which are density dependant.
	* Density dependant factors are those whose effect increases along with the size of the population.
	* e.g. loss of food supply, Predation.

## Controlling Population Growth
#### Negative Feedback

* Population variations usually occurs in line with another pattern such as the season cycle (Spring - Summber - Autumn - Winter) or amount of rainfall. 
* It is said that population variation is a process regulated by negative feedback.

> Negative feedback is where a monitored variable changes causing a reponse to be triggered and the result of the response counteracts the action which first affected the monitored variable.

## Competition

* In **any environment** plants and animals often have to **struggle to survive**.

*Competition In Plants:*

* Space
* Nutrients (including water)
* Light

*Competition in Animals:*

* Space
* Food 
* Shelter 
* Mates

## Competition
#### Types of Competition

###### Interspecific competion

* Occurs between members of different species.
* Each species occupies a given niche.
	* A nicheis the role that it carries out in the environment + space.
* Two species can not occupy the same niche, one has to win.

###### Intraspecific competion

* Occurs between individuals which are members of the same species.
* Dependant on density.
* Most organisms produce far more offspring than their habitat can support.
* If an organism is better adapted then it is more likely to win the competition and so survive.

## Fighting Pests

> A pest is any organisms which competes with or adversly affects a population of organisms that are important economically.

* Pests are fought with pesticides.
	* <small>Pesticides are chemicals which are used to control organisms.</small>
* When pests attack crops and animals the result is a reduction in yeild. This has an economic cost to the farmer.

Pests do this by:

* Pests are constantly competing with crop organisms for resources.
* Pests can cause desease in 'helpful' organisms which usually live on the crop.
* Pests can make infection through pathogens more likely.
* Pests can spoil food which is in transit or whilst the food is in storage.

**If a pest is causing a large amount of because it is present in very large numbers then it is worth the farmers while to spend money on controlling the pest.**

## Fighting Pests
#### Methods of Control

* When controlling pests either a chemical or biological control can be used.

!SLIDE

## Fighting Pests
#### Chemical Control

* Chemical control is the use of pesticides or insecticides which are designed to kill insects (or less commonly herbicides and fungicides).

*Advantages of Chemical Control:*

* Very effective
* Pest is controlled quickly
* Relatively little cost
* Can be applied on a small scale
* Application methods do not require a high level of skill or understanding

*Disadvantages of Chemical Control:*

* Pest can become resistant to the pesticide.
* Over exposure to some chemicals can also be hazardous to humans.
* Not specific enough and therfore can also kill off 'helpful' insects such as bees.
* Contamination of the food chain.

## Fighting Pests
#### Biological Control

* Interspecific competition between a predator and it's prey is used to control the pest population.

*Advantages of Biological Control:*

* Can repair some of the damage done by chemical control e.g. allowing resurgence of helpful species.
* Highly specific to one pest.
* Does no other damage to the ecosystem.
* Is a ong term pest control solution. </small> provided that a population equilibreum becomes established.</small>

*Disadvantages of Biological Control:*

* High initial reasearch cost. <small>(though it becomes cheaper as time passes.)</smalL>
* Frequent input needed.
* High level of skill and knowledge required - such as knowing the detailed knowledge of the pests life cycle.
* Potential to release an organism (like the cane toad) which can itself become a pest.
* Only a few success stories
* We do not know the control agent for a large number of our existing pest problems.
* Litte use to individuals except for in greenhouse/glasshouse.
* Needs to be carried out on a large scale.

## Fighting Pests
#### How biological control works

* bundance of prey is a factor limiting the number of its predators
* predator-prey relationship causes the population of both predator and prey to vary
* A benificial organism is released as a predator to the undesirable pest
* The aim of biological control is to reduce the pest population to a sensible level at which they no longer cause any economic damage.
* Sometime insect parasites are used and sometimes microorganisms are used. 

!SLIDE

## Fighting Pests
#### Best Method

* Both methods have a number of advantages and disadvantages
* => Best solution is to use a combination of biological and chemical control.
* These combined methods include producing pest resistant crops, chainging cultivation techniques and the use of highly targeted chemicals.

Such a solution is often refered to as an **integrated pest control solution**.
