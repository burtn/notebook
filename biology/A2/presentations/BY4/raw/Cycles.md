## The Carbon Cycle

> The flow of carbon through living organisms and the environment.

!SLIDE

## The Carbon Cycle
#### Start

Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere throgh:

* Respiration of animals
* Respiration of micro-organisms
* Respiration of plants
* Burning follsil fuels
	* coal
	* oil
	* etc

!SLIDE

## The Carbon Cycle
#### Plants

* Plants use up almost all of the carbon dioxide released in forming carbohydrates, fats and proteins.

!SLIDE

## The Carbon Cycle
#### Death

* When plants (and animals) die their bodies are decomposed by Saprobionts.
* Saprobionts are micro-organisms which obtain their food from the decaying remains of other organisms.
* They are found in soil.
* They release carbon stored in the organism over its lifetime - releasing it as a gas into the atmosphere.

!SLIDE

## The Carbon Cycle
#### Global Warming

* Level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been rising.
* Primary cause is human activities.
	* e.g.
	* deforestation
		* deforestation removes photosynthesising species so less carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere.
	* combustion of fossil fuels

!SLIDE

## The Nitrogen Cycle

> The flow of both inorganic and organic nitrogen through organisms and their environment.

* The cycle involves interchange between nitrogenous compounds some of which are solid and gaseous nitrogen.

!SLIDE

## The Nitrogen Cycle
#### Nitrogen use

* Component of amino acids
	* => proteins also
* Component of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA)
* Neither plants or animals can use atmospheric nitrogen
* Plants get nitrogen by taking in nitrates in solution through their roots
* This nitrogen passes up the food chain when the plants are consumed.
* Nitrogen remains 'locked up' in organisms dead bodies.
	* It must be decomposed along with excrement to re-enter the soil.

## The Nitrogen Cycle
#### Process

1. Putrefaction (sometimes ammonification) - *putrefaction is where bacteria and fungi (decomposers) break down dead plants, animals and their excterory products into ammonium ions.
2. Ammonia is converted to nitrates throguh nitrates in a process called nitrification.
	This process involves bacteria like Nitrosomonas (ammonium -> nitrite) and Nitrobacter (nitrite -> nitrate) this means aerobic conditions are required.
3. Atmospheric nitrogen is converted into nitrogen compounds by nitrogen fixation.
	+ Lightning performs this.
	+ Azotobactor (a free living bacterium) also does this.
	+ Symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria also do this.
		- Rhizobium are found in legumes (peas, clover etc).
		- The provide some nitrogen to the plant and some to the soil.
4. Nitrogen is released back into the atmosphere by denitrification.
	+ This also involved bacteria **these need anaerobic conditions** (water logged soil etc)
	+ Pseudomonas is one example.

## The Nitrogen Cycle
#### Improving nitrogen circulation

* Farming practices can improve ntrogen circulation
	* Planning clover fields encourages nutrogen fixation
	* Ploughing fields aerates the soil to create aerobic conditions
	* Draining water logged fields reduces denitrification
	* Using animal waster as manure also helps
* Industrial processes can also improve nitrogen circulation
	* we can fix nitrogen ourselves through the haber process (making fertilser)
	* Microorganisms can be used to make compost
	* Proper sewage disposal increases the supply of organic nitrogen
