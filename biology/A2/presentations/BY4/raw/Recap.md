## Homeostasis

* Homeostasis is the maintenance of **constant internal environment**.
* Homeostasis uses **negative feedback**.

!SLIDE

## Homeostasis
##### Waste

* The removal of **metabolic waste products** from the body is called **excretion**
* Different organisms produce different metabolic waste products.

!SLIDE

## Homeostasis
##### The Kidney

* The kidney(s) are the primary organ of the **urinary system**.
* Kidneys are made up of a number of **nephrons**.
* The the kidneys small molecules are removed from the blood by **ultrafiltration**.
* Ultrafiltration takes place in the **glomerulus**.
* The result of ultrafiltration is **glomerular filtrate**.
* Glomerular filtrate passes through the nephron and becomes urine.
* During passage through the nephron **selective reabsorbtion** takes place.
* Selective reabsorption takes substances the body needs back into the blood.

!SLIDE

## Homeostasis
##### Controlling water potential

* Water potential has the symbol &Psi;
* Water potential of the blood is monitored by **osmoreceptros** in the **hypothalamus** of the brain.
* The reabsorption of water is controlled by the hormone ADH.
* ADH controls the permeability of the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule to water.
* ADH is secreted from the pituitary gland.

## Microbiology
#### Classficication

* Bacteria can be classified by two methods.
	* Shape
	* Reaction to the gram statining process.
		* Bacterial species with walls containing small amounts of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide are Gram-negative.
		* Bacteria with walls containing large amounts peptidoglycan and no lipopolysaccharide are Gram-positive.

## Microbiology
#### Growth

* In optimum conditions (which vary from bacteria to bacteria) bacteria can devide every 20 minutes.
* Bacteria are cultured in a sterile environment using sterile techniques.
* Bacteria can be counted with a viable count (living cells) or a total count (living and dead).
* To get a sample of bacteria that can be counted a serial dilution must be used.
* Bacteria and fungi can be cultivated on an industrial scale.
	* One example of this is the production of penicillin.

!SLIDE

## Microbiology
#### Penicillin Production

* Penicillin is produced by batch fermentation.
* Penicillin is a secondary metabolite.
* Secondary metabolites are only produced when the organisms is 'stressed' e.g when nutrients become depleted.
* On the sigmoid growth curve for bacteria this would be just as the log phase transitions into the stationary phase.

!SLIDE

## Nervous System

* The nervous system controls an organisms actions.
* Stimuli are detected through receptors.
* Once an impulse is received from a receptor the nervous system triggers responses whcih are carried out by effectors.
* A reflex is an involuntary action.
* Receptors, neurones (motor, sensory and relay) and effectors form a reflex arc.
* Nerve transmission is caused by an action potential.
* An action potential is produced by changes in the permeability of the axon membrane to sodium ions.
* Both the diameter of the axon and the presence of the myelin sheath affect impulse tranmission speed.
* Synaptic transmission is affected by a number of drugs.
* The transfer of information between neurons happens through the secretion of a neurotransmitter across synapses.

!SLIDE

## Photoperiodism

* Plant responses are slower than animal responses.
* Plant responses only involve hormones.
* Photoperiodism is the reponse of plants to the length of daylight and darkness.
* Photoperiodism involves a light sensitive pigment known as phytochrome.
* Phytochrome exists in two forms, Pr and Pfr.
* The relative amount of each form of phytochrome in each form is used by the plant to measure the day length.

!SLIDE

## Photosynthesis

> Photosynthesis is the process by which plants synthesise organic molecules from carbon dioxide and water using energy provided by photons.

* Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast of the plant cell.
* In the chloroplasts are photosystems which consist of photosynthetic pigments grouped together.
* The photosystem consists of two parts, the antenna complex and reaction centre.
* The antenna complex funnels photons of light to the reaction centre.
* The reaction centre consists of a molecule of chlorophyll a

## Photosynthesis
#### Process <small>(Light dependant)/small>

* The first stage of photosyntehsis is known as the light dependant phase.
* The light dependant phase takes place in the thylakoid membrane.
* The products of this (ATP and NADP) are used in the light independant phase.

*Steps:*

* The absorbption of the photons energy by the reaction centre causes two of chlorophyll a's electrons to become excited and move to a higher energy state.
* These electrons are then passed to a series of electron acceptors.
* This results in the formation of ATP by photophosphorlyation (since light is used).

!SLIDE

## Photosynthesis
#### Process <small>(Light Independant)</small>

* The light independant phase takes place in the stroma.
* As part of this carbon dioxide is fixed to convert it into carbohydrate using the products of the light dependant phase.

#### General

* The synthesis of ATP occurs in both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
* Photolysis (of water) takes place to replace lost electrons in chlorophyll.

## Populations

- A populations size is increased by birth and imigration.
- A populations size is decreased by death and emigration.
- A populations maximum size is determined by both the carrying capacity of the environment and environmental resistance.
- Population changes can be dependant or independant on density.
- A given population follows a pattern of growth that if graphed gives an S-shape curve.
- Pests can be controlled by either chemical or biological methods. Both methods have a number of advantages and disadvantages.
- In the nitrogen cycle several bateria play an important role (which are they?)
- Organisms which are involved in the cycling of nutrients within ecosystems and referred to as decomposers.

## Respiration

> Respiration is a series of reactions which take place withhin the cells of organisms.
> As a result of these reactions energy is released from organic molecules like glucose.

* The energy released from respiration is in the form of ATP.
* ATP is made from a molecule of ADP and Pi.
* In order to add phosphate group to a molecule (here ADP + Pi => ATP) a phosphorlylaton must take place.

## Respiration
#### Stages

The 4 stages of respiration are...

* Glycolysis
* The Link Reaction
* The Krebs Cycle
* The Electron Transport Chain

!SLIDE

## Respiration
#### Glycolysis

* Glycolysis is the first step of respiration.
* Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm.
* Glycolysis takes a glucose and splits it into two molcules of pyruvate.
* This process releases **ATP (net gain 2) and reduced NAD (NADH)**.

!SLIDE

## Respiration
#### The Link Reaction

* The link reaction follows glycolysis.
* The link reacton converts **pyruvate into Acetyl CoA** which enters the mitochondrion to be used in the krebs cycle.

!SLIDE

## Respiration
#### Krebs Cycle

* The krebs cycle produces **ATP and Carbon Dioxide**.
* It is carried out **twice** for each glucose molecule.
	* ... as 1 glucose = 2 pyruvate after glycolysis.
* The krebs cycle also produces **reduced electron carriers** - NADH and FADH.
* These carriers take electrons to the electron transport chain.

!SLIDE

## Respiration
#### The Electron Transport Chain

* The electron transport chain uses the energy provided by electrons to pump protons across the membrane of the mitochondrion.
* This creates an **electro-chemical gradient**.
* This allows ATP to be produced by ATP synthase in a process called **oxidative phosphorylation**.

!SLIDE

## Respiration
#### Energy 'Budget'

* For each molecule of glucose **37/38 ATP** molecules can be produced.
* Anaerobic respiration only produces **2 ATP** molecules for each glucose.
