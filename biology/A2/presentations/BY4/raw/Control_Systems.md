## Homeostasis

> The maintaining of a consistent internal environment within a living organism.

Examples:

+ Bloog sugar concentration
+ Kidney function
+ Body temperature

!SLIDE

## Homeostasis
#### Negative feedback

* Self regulating systems work on a principal called negative feedback.
* For each controlled variable there exists a desired value.
* The desired value is the point at which the system works optimally.

!SLIDE

## Homeostasis
#### Chain of action

* Control variable deviates from optimum value.
	* Receptor detects change from normal.
	* Receptor sends instructions to co-ordinator.
	* Co-ordinator sends signals to effecors.
	* Effectors carry out processes to correct change.
	* Value is returned to normal.
* Detector is 'reset' and the process can begin again.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation

> Osmoregulation is the homeostatic control of body water.

<span class="label label-important">Important</span>
Like other homeostatic processes, osmoregulation relies on negtive feedback.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Components

* Receptors **in the hypothalamus** which are responsible for **detecting change in blood water potential**.
* The *co-ordinator* - posterior lobe of the **pituitary gland**.
* *Effectors* - the collecting ducts of the kidneys.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Biology

* The permeability of the walls of the collecting duct can be varied with a hormone called ADH.
* ADH is secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland 
* The permeability of the collecting duct walls controls the amount of water that is taken back into the bloodstream.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Definitions

+ **Hypotonic** - *Having a lower osmotic pressure than a particular fluid.*
+ **Hypertonic** - *Having a higher osmotic pressure than a particular fluid.*
+ **Osmotic Pressure** - *The hydrostatic pressure produced by a solution in a space divided by a semipermeable membrane due to a difference in the concentrations of solute.*

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Causes of water loss

* Excessive sweating
* High salt intake
* Reduced water consupmption.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Salt levels

* The level of sodium chloride (salt) in the blood is an indication of the total amount of water in the body.
* The salt concentration sets the water potential of the blood.
	* It is this property that is measured by the hypothalamus.

!SLIDE

## Osmoregulation
#### Function

* Low water level in the blood causes osmotic receptors in the hypothalamus to fire nerve impulses.
* The nerve impulses travel to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland.
* On receiving the signal the gland secreates ADH into the blood.
* The ADH travels in the blood to capilaries in the walls of the collecting duct.
* The ADH causes an increase in the permeability of both the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule.
* More water absorbed back into blood via medulla.
* Produces small and concentrated urine.
* Cycle repeats in both directions to keep water potential optimum.

## The Kidney

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Functions of the Kidney

* Removal of nitrogenous waste from the body.
* blood pressure control.
* salt and water concentration maintenance.

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Nitrogenous waste

> Nitrogenous waste products are those containing nitrogen produced from metabolic processes.

Three forms:

* Urea from amino acids.
* Uric acid from nucleic acids. e.g. DNA, RNA.
* Creatinine from creatine phosphate.
	* <small>creatine is an energy store in muscles.</small>

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Humans

* Humans excrete urea as their form of nitrogenous waste.
* Initiall the free nitrogens from metabolic process combine with other molecules to produce compounds like ammonia.
* Ammonia is highly toxic and insoluable.
* To reduce toxicity the ammonia is converted to urea which is less toxic.
	* Urea is also water soluable to it can easily be removed.
* Urea is removed in the urine of which it is a major component.

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Protein breakdown

* If our diet consists of too much protein it has to be broken down as it can't be stored.
* In the liver the amino acids which make up proteins are deamminated - this involves removing their amine group.
* This produces ammonia which is converted to urea.

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Ammonia -> Urea

* Ammonia is produced by reacting deamminated amino acids with oxygen.
* This is converted to urea by the addition of carbon dioxide.
* Keyto acid is also produced by this reaction.
* Keyto acid can be made into pyruvate (pyruvic acid) for use in respiration.
* Keyto acid can also be made into fat for storage.

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Birds

* Unlike humans birds produce thick urine consisting of uric acid.
* Uric acid is less toxic than urea.
* Uric acid requires more energy to produce than urea because it is a more complex molecule.
* Birds produce thick urine because they carry less water in order to reduce their weight.

!SLIDE

## The Kidney
#### Structure

* We have two kidneys.
* Each kidney contains approx. one million uriniferous tubules.
	* These tubules are called nephrons.
* Each nephron consists of a bowmans capsule, distal and proximal convoluted tubules, a loop of Henle and a collecting duct.
* Within each bowmans capsule is a number of capillaries collectively called the glomerulus.
* Blood enters the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole.
* Blood leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole.
* The efferent arteriole takes the blood to two seperate capillary systems.
	* One capillary network (the vasa recta) runs beside the loop of henle.
	* The other serves the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.
	
!SLIDE

# Ultrafiltration

> Ultrafiltration is the process that occurs in the kidneys to remove small soluable molecules from blood plasma.

* Ultrafiltration occus under high pressure.


!SLIDE

## Ultrafiltration
#### Process

* Water, glucose and urea along with salts pass from the glomerular capilaries to the Bowman's capsule.
* The fluid in the Bowmans capsule is primary urine or glomerular filtrate.
* The fluid passes through the proximal convoluted tubule, and the loop of henle before reaching the collecting duct.
* Once the fluid has reached the collecting duct it is called urine.

!SLIDE

## Ultrafiltration
#### Process (detail)

* Blood in the glomeruls is seperated from the Bowman's capusle by the basement membrane/
* The basement membrane has holes which only allow small molcules through.
	* Small molecules include: glucose and other sugars.
	* Large molecules include: proteins.
* The blood in the glomerulus is under high pressure so the small molecules 'leak' into the bowmans capsule.

!SLIDE

## Ultrafiltration
#### Kidney damage

* The presence of proteins in urine is a symptom of high blood pressure.
	* High blood pressure can force proteins through the basement membrante that wouldn't fit otherwise.
* Basement membrane damage can also let blood cells into the urine.
	* Blood in urine however is more likely to arise from other sources.

!SLIDE

## Ultrafiltration
#### Glomerulus Structure

* The glomerulus is specially 'designed' for ultrafiltration.
* The basement membrane acts like a seive structure.
* The basement membrane is layered between two other structures.
	* The capillary wall which consists of small gaps.
	* The wall of the Bowman's capsule which has special epithelial cells called podocytes.
	
!SLIDE

## Ultrafiltration
#### Pressure source

* The pressure for ultrafiltration is hydrostatic pressure.
* Pressure increased by...
	* capillaries because of the small diameter of the efferent arteriole.
	* water potential of blood die to colloidal plasma proteins.
* Overall pressure in glomerulus can be varied with the diameter of either of the efferent and afferent arterioles.

# Reabsorption

!SLIDE

# Reabsorption
#### Materials

Substances that are reabsorbed include:

* Glucose
* Salts
* Water

* Urine is left over which passes to the bladder.

!SLIDE

# Reabsorption
#### Location

* Occurs throughout nephron.
* Glucose + Water reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule.
* Water + Salts in distal convoluted tubule.
* Water in collecting duct (process involves loop of Henle)

#### Mode of reabsorption

* Glucose and salts are reabsorbed by active transport.
* Water is passivly absorbed by osmosis.
	* This process takes place after the salts have been removed.

!SLIDE

# Reabsorption
#### Loop of Henle

* The loop of Henle plays a role in water reabsorption.
* Loop of Henle concentrates salts in the tissue fluid of the medulla.
* The high salt concentration causes osmotic flow from collecting duct.
* Makes urine concentrated and hypertonic (w/ respect to blood).

!SLIDE

# Reabsorption
#### Loop of Henle (Principles)

* The loop of Henle operates on a hairpin counter current multiplier.
* As fluid flows into the ascending limb sodium and chloride ions are pumped from the limb.
* Low water potential created at apex of loop.
* Water leaves glomerula filtrate from descending limb <small>(as ascending is impermeable)</small>
* Water taken away by blood in the vasa recta.


* Water is drawn out of collecting duct because of low water potential in medulla from large amounts of this process.

!SLIDE

# Reabsorption
#### Adaptation of cells for absorption

* Proximal convoluted tubule cells have microvill & large number of mitochondria

Microvili:

* Create large surface area for absorption.

Mitochondria:
* Large numbers to provide enough ATP.
* ATP produced by respiration on mitochondria.
* ATP used in active transport of ions.

!SLIDE

# Adaptations for different environments

* Different animals produce different types of nitrogenous base.
* Different disposal mechnism required for each type of waste.

!SLIDE

# Adaptations for different environments
#### Environment

* The animals environment plays a large role in the type of nitrogenous waste produced.
* Fish are an example of this.
	* Fish produce ammonia which is highly toxic.
	* However fish are surrounded by water.
	* This allows ammonia to diffuse across gills.
	* Water dilutes the ammonia to a safe level.
	
!SLIDE

# Adaptations for different environments
#### Birds

* Birds (like insects) produce uric acid.
* Uric acid is insoluable.
* Uric acid is non toxic.
* Uric acid has a higher 'energy cost' because it is more complicated.
* No water is required to excrete Uric acid.
	* This makes birds lighter.
* Since it is less toxic the birds can also store it in higher concentrations.

!SLIDE

# Adaptations for different environments
#### Mammals

* Mammals in hot/arid conditions (e.g. deserts) have adapted to have a longer loop of Henle.
	* The longer loop of Henle causes a greater solute concentration to form in the medulla.
	* This in turn causes more water to be reabsorbed.
	* This produced highly concentrated urine.

Examples of such animals include the Kangaroo rat.

!SLIDE

# Adaptations for different environments
#### Further adaptations for the desert

* Some animals make use of metabolic water when there is little in their environment.
* Metabolic water is produced by the breakdown of food reserves during respiration.
* Desert animals also live underground during the day.
	* Burrows etc are cool and humid so lose less water from evaporation.
