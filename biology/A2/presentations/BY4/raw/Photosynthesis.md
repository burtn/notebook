## Summary

> Photosynthesis provides energy for plants. To do this light energy is converted to chemical energy stored in molecules of ATP.

* Photosynthesis has two phases - light dependant and idependant.
* Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of green leaves. (Engelmann1887)
	* Engelmann carried out an experiment to determine which wavelength of light was most effective in photosynthesis using green algae.

## Pigments in Photosynthesis

* White light is a mixture of different wavelengths.
* Different wavelengths are trapped by different photosynthetic pigments.
*  There are two main types of pigments in angiosperms (flowering plants).
	* Chlorophylls - absorb light which is primarilly in the in the red end of the spectrum.
	* Carotenoids - absorb wavelengths which are primarily in the blue end of the spectrum.
		* The carotenoid group can be split into a further two pigments, carotenes and xanthophylls.
		* These act as accessory pigments funneling energy to chlorophyll a - a primary pigment in the reaction centre.

## Spectra

* Absorbption spectra and action spectra show the rate of photosynthesis and light absorbption.
	*  The absorption spectrum is a graph that indicates how much light a given pigment absorbs.
	* The action spectrum graph shows the rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light.
* Comparing the two graphs shows a correlation between the absorption and action spectra which leads to the conclusion that the pigments are responsible for absorbing the wavelenghts of light used in photosynthesis.

## Use the light Luke

* The photons of light from the light source (more often than not - the sun) are said to be 'harvested' for photosynthesis.
* Harvesting is performed by photosystems of which there are two.
	* PSI - PS700 -> 700nm light
	* PS2 - PS680 -> 680nm light
* Both photosystems are formed around a molecule of chlorophyll a which is the reaction centre of the photosystem.
* The reaction centre is surrounded by accessory pigments clustered together.
* Photosystems are groups of many hundred molecules in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
* Associated with each pigment in the antenna complex is a protein which aids in the 'funneling' of the photons in the chloroplast to the reaction centre.

## Light Dependant <small>aka Phase 1</small>

The light dependant phase consists of several smaller reactions...

* Photolysis - the splitting of water molecules using energy from photons (light) to produce hydrogen ions and electrons.
* NADP Reduction (into reduced NADP (NADPH)).
* ATP Synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This is called photophosphorylation.

* All the reactions of the light dependant phase of photosynthesis occur within the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast.

#### Process 

1. Photons of light hit a photosystem and pass down to the primary pigment.
2. The energy from the photons excites electrons in chloropyll a.
3. The excited electrons leave chlorophyll and pass to electron acceptors.
4. ATP can be produced in two ways, cyclic or non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
	* Cyclic phosphorylation occurs when no oxygen is present.
5. As in respiration proton pumps create a gradient for ATP production.
6. The ATP and reduced NADP passes to the light dependant stage.

!SLIDE

*Cyclic Photophophorylation:*

* Only uses photosystem 1.

1. Electrons are excited from chlorophyll a.
2. An electron acceptor passes them to electron carriers.
3. The electrons return down energy levels to the photosystem.
4. The energy lost from this process drives production of ATP by powering proton pumps.

!SLIDE

*Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation:*

* Involves photosystem 1 and 2.

1. Photosystem 2 first absorbs the photons.
2. The photons pass down the antenna complex to the reaction centre.
3. 2 electrons from chlorophyll are excited into a high energy state.
4. Electron acceptors pick up the photons and pass them along a series of electron carriers to photosytem one.
5. On the way to PSI they give some energy to proton pumps as well as to each carrier.
6. The energy lost here is used to drive ATP synthesis.
7. The electrons arrive at PSI to replace those that were just from also absorbing photons.
8. PS2 is unstable having lost electrons so these are then replaced by those from photolysis.
	* Photolysis casuses water to be split into hydrogen, oxygen and elecrons.
9. The electron acceptor which receieved electrons from photosystem one releases some of its electrons to the Hydrogen ions which are found outside the thylakoid membrane.
10. The electrons join with NADP to form reduced NADP.
11. The NADPH and ATP travel to the light indenpendant reactions.

## Light Independant <small>aka Phase 2</small>

* The light independant phase of photosynthesis makes used of the products from the light dependant phase - ATP and NADP.
* Involves a series of enzyme catalysed reactions which use ATP and NADP to reduce carbon dioxide (fix carbon) to synthesise hexose sugar.
* Referred to as the calvin cycle.

!SLIDE

*The Calvin Cycle:*

1. The cycle starts with a five carbon molecule called RuBP.
2. The RuBP combines with carbon dioxide to form an unstable six carbon compound. (catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCo)
3. The unstable 6C molecule splits immediately into two molecules of GP.
4. GP is the phosphorylated by ATP and reduced by NADP into triose phosphate (TP).
5. Some of the TP can be removed from the cycle and built into glucose phosphate and starch by condensation.
6. The remaining TP is used to regenerate RuBP  through a series of ATP powered reactions.

* The NADP is also remade and returns to the light dependant phase so that it can be reduced, and the reused again.

!SLIDE

## Synthesis

> The TP that is removed from the light indepedant phase of photoysnthesis (the calvin cycle) is metabolised into a number of products.

Theses products inlcude:

* Carbohydrates.
* Proteins.
* Lipids.

These can then be built into almost all the molecules the plant needs for life.
The remaning molecules require some inorganic ions which the plant takes from the environment.

There are two different groups of nutrient: **micronutrents** which are needed in very small amounts and **macronutrients** which are needed in small (but larger than micro) amounts.

* Micronutrients include copper and manganese.
* Macronutrients include magnesium, calcium and nitrogen.

## Synthesis
#### Use of nutrients

* Nitrogen is taken into the plant by the roots in the form of nitrates.
	* Nitrates are transported around the plant in the xylem.
	* Amino acids are transported in the phloem.
	* Nitrogen is used for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.
	* If a plant has a nitrogen deficiency it shows symptoms such as reduced growth and chlorosis<sup>1</sup>

* Magnesium forms part of the chlorophyll molecule.
	* It is absorbed as magnesium ions.
	* The ions are transported in the xylem.
	* All of the plants tissues require magnesium because it also actives ATPase.
	* Magnesium defficiency can also lead to chlorosis.
		* Magnesium defficiency chlorosis can be identified because it occurs between the veins of old leaves. This is a result of the mangnesium being diverted to new leaves where it can be put to better use.

[1] Chlorosis is the yellowing of the leaves caused by a drop in chlorophyll production.
