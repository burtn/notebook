## Classification

> Microorganism refers to a large group including fungi, bacteria, viruses and protoctists.

* Bacteria can be classified in one of two ways.
	* Shape
	* Reaction to the gram staining process

!SLIDE

## Classification
#### Shape classification

* Bacteria can be one of three shapes...

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>Appearance</th>
		<th>Scientific name</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rod shaped</td>
		<td>Bacillus</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Spherical</td>
		<td>Cocci</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Screw shaped</td>
		<td>Spirillum</td>
	</tr>
</table>

* e.g. Streptococcus is a Cocci

!SLIDE

## Classification
#### Gram staining

* Divides bacteria into two groups, gram negative and gram positive.
* Difference caused by cell wall structure.

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>Gram negative</th>
		<th>Gram positive</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Complex cell wall</td>
		<td>Simple cell wall</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wall contains liposaccharides</td>
		<td>Wall contains only murein</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Does not stain with crystal violet</td>
		<td>Is stained by crystal violet</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Stained red/pink</td>
		<td>Stained purple</td>
	</tr>
</table>

!SLIDE

## Classification
#### Bacteria cell wall

* Bacteria cell wall is made of polysaccharides and polypeptides interchangeably called murein or peptodoglycan.
* The polysaccharides are cross linked to give the cell wall strength and shape.
* The cell wall prevents lysis (cell bursting) from osmosis.

!SLIDE

## Classification
#### Properties of bacteria

* Gram negative bacteria are not affected by the enzyme lysozyme.
* Lysozyme is antibacterial (found in tears).
* Gram negative bacteria are also penicillin resistant.
* Grap positive bacteria are more suceptible to antibiotics.

!SLIDE

## Aseptic technique

* To grow bacteria sucessfully in the lab aspetic techniques are used.
* Aseptic techniques keep other equipment sterile and free from contamination.
* This prevents the cultures from becoming contaminated as well as the environment.

!SLIDE

## Aseptic technique
#### Preventing culture contamination

* Prevents pure cultures from being contaminated with environmental bacteria.
* Growing media and apparatus should be sterilised before use.
* Work near an updraft (bunsen burner)
* Using sterile loops (dipped and flamed in meths)
* Flaming bottle necks 

!SLIDE

## Aseptic technique
#### Preventing environment contamination

* Sterilise work surfaces before and after with disinfectant e.g. Virkon.
* Autoclave equipment.
	* Autoclacing heats equipment to 121 degrees C under steam pressure.
	* Autclaving takes 15 miins.
	* Kills endospores and gram positive bacteria e.g. Clostridium.
* Other materials should be autoclaved for proper disposal e.g. petri dishes.
* In a comercial setting it is more likely that radiation will be used to perform the sterilisation.

!SLIDE

## Aseptic technique
#### Endospores

* Endospores are internal resting cells which protect the nuclear material through unfavourable material.
* Endospores can become bacterial cells again after conditions have improved, re-contaminating an area.
* For this reason extra care has to be taken working with strains that can form endospores.

!SLIDE

## Growing microorganisms

* Microorganisms can be grown on a variety of mediums in the lab given the correct conditions.
* Microorganisms reproduce quickly - dividing by binary fission every 20 mins.

!SLIDE

## Growing microorganisms
#### Conditions for growth

* Different microrganisms require different conditions to grow optimally.

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>Condition</th>
		<th>Value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>pH</td>
		<td>Bacteria 'prefer' 7.4 (alkaline) whilst fungi et al prefer acidic conditions.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Temperature</td>
		<td>Depends on enzymes used, most bacteria grow in 25-45 degrees C. Pathogens have an optimum of 37 or similar which is body temperature.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Nutrients</td>
		<td>Microorganisms need nitrogen, carbon (from glucose), vitamins & mineral salts</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Oxygen</td>
		<td>Obligate aerobes require oxygen for growth. Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. Faculative anaerobes grow best with oxygen but can survive without its presence.</td>
	</tr>

## Growing microorganisms
#### Measuring populations

* Broadly speaking there exist two (categories of) methods...
	* Direct e.g. Viable count or Total count
	* Indirect e.g. Turbidity
	
* Turbidity measures the 'cloudiness' of a culture.
* Total counts measure the number of living and dead cells.
* Viable counts include only living cells.

!SLIDE

## Growing microorganisms
#### Serial dilutions <small>performing a viable count</small>

* It is difficult to count a large population of microorganisms even with computers.
* To overcome this a serial dilution is performed.
* A 1cm<sup>2</sup> sample of the culture to be counted is added to 9cm<sup>2</sup> test tubes of distilled (sterile) water.
* Each time the sample is transferred e.g. Original -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 the dilution factor increases by a factor of 10.
* Multiplying the number of cells that grow after plating out each dilution by 1/dilution factor gives an estimate of the number of cells in the original sample.

<strong>This works on the assumption that each colony on the growing plates arises from a single cell.</strong>

!SLIDE

## Growing microorganisms
#### Other methods

* Make estimates from the diameter of a colony (from a central point)
* Haemocytometer - a special microscope slide. (also used in blood counts, sperm counts etc)

!SLIDE

## Fermentation

* Industrial fermentation is used to culutre *bacteria or fungi* on an industril scale.
* Examples include: penicillin and insulin.

!SLIDE

## Fermentation
#### Advantages

* Microbes grow quickly.
* Lower temperatures can be used because enzymes do not have to be supplied.
* Reduced cost.

!SLIDE

## Fermentation
#### Batch culture

<strong>Batch cultures are used to collect products that are secondary metabolites.</strong>

* Pure culture is used => pure product.
* Batch culture fermenter provides the suitable conditions for growth that give maximum efficiency.

To ensure ideal conditions...

* ...forced aeration may be used to add oxygen.
* ...mixing may be used to ensure maximum contact between organism and nutrients.
* ...suitable temperature maintained with a water jacket.
* ... air inlets may have spargers for imporced aeration.
* ... sophisticates (read: expsensive) monitoring systems may be used to control conditions.

!SLIDE

## Fermentation
#### Penicillin production <small>(batch culture)</small>

* Penicillin is a **secondary metabolite**.
* It is produced by fungi of the genus *Penicillium*.
* Often it is the species *Penicillium Notatum* that is used.
* Produced approx. 30 hours after batch fermentation begins.
* After a week there is sufficient penicillin to filter and purify from the medium.
* <strong>The fermenter is then re-sterilised so that it can be used again.</strong> <small>(this is what makes it batch fermentation)</small>

!SLIDE

## Fermentation
#### Penicillin production <small>(secondary metabolites)</small>

* Antibiotoics are often secondary metabolites.
* They are produced at the point in the organisms lifecycle where condtions become to change away from the optimum.
* In this case the organism is said to be 'stressed'.
* It takes place in the stationary phase of the organisms growth.
* Penicillin production is thought to be a response to competition from bacteria with which the fungi compete.

!SLIDE

## Fermentation
#### Continuous cultivation

* Better from collecting **primary metabolites**.
* Allows production to continue for a long period of time rather than in batches with sterilisation in between.

* Insulin is a product that is produced in this manner.
