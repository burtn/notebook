## ATP Uses

> ATP is an molecule used for energy storage.
>> ATP is 'the universal energy currency'.

Using ATP rather than glucose gives a number of advantages...

* ATP releases energy in small amounts as and when it is needed.
	* Glucose releases large amount of energy that can generate enough heat to cause cell death.
* ATP provides a common source of energy for a wide range of biological processes and chemical reactions.
* ATP gives more control the the cell and increases efficiency
* ATP only requires one enzyme to release energy whilst glucose requires many.

## ATP Roles

* ATP involved in wide range of biological processes
	* Muscle contraction
	* Active transport
	* Protein synthesis
	* DNA synthesis
	* Packaging of secretory products into vesicles.
	* Nerve transmision (sodium - potassium pumps)

## ATP Structure

* ATP Is a nucleotide made up of an organic base, five carbon sugar and phosphate groups.

## The importance of ATP

* Organisms prevent cell death by releasing energy gradually.
* Energy is released from ATP in 30 kJ / mol increments.
	* This is the same amount of free energy that is initially stored in the molecule.

## The importance of ATP
#### ATP Production

* ATP is made by adding an phosphate group to ADP.
* This process is endergonic.
* It requires 30 KJ of energy per mol to do this.
* The phosphate is bound to the ADP through high energy bonds.

## The importance of ATP
#### ATP Breakdon

* Energy from ATP is relased by hydrolysis into phosphate and ADP.
* This reactions is exergonic.
* Hydrolysis of ATP is catalysed by ATP-ase.
* The reaction releases 30 KJ/mol of energy.
* The removed phosphate can be used to lower the activation energy of other molecules.

## The importance of ATP
#### Phosphorylation

> Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group.

There are three forms of phosphorylation:

* Oxidative phosphorylation
* Substrate-level phosphorylation
* Photophosphorylation

!SLIDE

## The importance of ATP
#### Oxidative phosphorylation

* Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the membranes of mitochondria.
* It is part of aerobic respiration.
* Oxidative phosphorylation involves electron transport.

!SLIDE

## The importance of ATP
#### Photophosphorylation

* Occurs on membranes of chloroplasts.
* Part of photosynthesis.

!SLIDE

## The importance of ATP
### Substrate-level phosphorylation

* Phosphate groups are taken from 'donor' molecules and transferred onto the ATP.
* Carried out when other methods will not work e.g. with little oxygen.
