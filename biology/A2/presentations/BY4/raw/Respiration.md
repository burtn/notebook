## Glycolysis

* The first stage in cellular respiration.
* Takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell.

*Steps:*

1. Glucose is combined with two ATP molecules to form hexose phosphate (6C).
2. The hexose phosphate is split into two molecules of triose phosphate (3C).
3. The triose phosphate is dehydrogenated to form pyruvate.
4. The removed hydrogen is used to reduce a molecule of NAD to NADH.
5. 4 ATP molecules are synthesised by substrate level phosphorylation.

This leaves a net gain of 2 ATP after this process.

<small>
	The molecules of NADH that are produced during glycolysis have the potential to produce six further molecules of ATP provided that the conditions for aerobic respiration are maintained.

## Link Reaction

* The link reaction joins together glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.
* Pyruvate diffuses from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix
* It is then decarboxylated and dehydrogenated.
* The hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of pyruvate is accpeted by NAD to form reduced NAD (NADH).
* This forms a two carbon acetate which binds with coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A.
* The AcetlyCoA enterts the krebs cycle.

## Krebs Cycle

1. Acetly CoA enters the Krebs cycle by combining with RuBP (4C) to form an unstable 6C compound.
2. During this reaction the A CoA is regenerated so it can be used again.
3. The 6C compound is repeatedly decarboxylated and dehydienated into a 4C compound.
	* The hydrogens which are produced are 'collected' by molecules of NAD to form three molecules of reduced NAD and one of FAD.
	* CO2 is produced from the decarboxylation process.
4. The 4C compound is used to regenerate RuBP.
5. The carrier molecules (NAD and FAD) transport hydrogen to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they act as triggers for the start of the elctron transport process.

Only one additional molecule of ATP is produced in the Krebs cycle.

<strong>Note though that two pyruvate molecules are produced as a result of glycolysis so in fact two ATP molecules of ATP are produced from glycolysis products as the Krebs cycle happens 2x for each glucose.</strong>

## Electron Transport

> Electron tranport involves the transportation of electrons through a series of pumps and carriers which releases energy as an ATP molecule.

* FAD Produces 2 ATP molecules in this step.
* NADH Produces 3 ATP molecules in this step.

* In order to explain the synthesis of ATP using the electron transport chain a model known as Chemiosmotic theory is used.

## Electron Transport
#### Chemiosmotic Theory

> Chemiosmotic theory proposes that the energy for ATP synthesis is proviede by an electorchemical gradient of protons across a cell membrane.

1. NAD 'donates' the elctrons of the hydrogen atoms it carries to the first pump in the chain
2. The pump then pumps the protons into the inter membrane space.
3. The electrons with a reduced energy level are then transferred by a carrier to the next pump along in the chain.
4. More protons are pumped across the membrane.
5. A high concentration of protons builds up in the inter membrane space.
6. ATP synthetase forms a channel which allows the protons to diffuse down the concentration gradient.
7. Every time 3 protons pass through ATP synthetase ADP and Pi are combined to make ATP.
8. The last pump in the elxtron transport chain has no where to move it's electrons too so instead they are bound to oxygen. (OXYGEN IS THE FINAL ELECTRON ACCEPTOR)
9. This forms a molecule of water in a reaction catalysed by an oxidase enzyme.

* This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation.

## Anaerobic Respiration

> Anaerobic respiration is the the process of respiration that occurs in conditions where there is an absence of oxygen.

* Withough oxygen only glycolysis can take place.

*In yeast/microogranisms:*

* Ethanol is produced by fermentation.

1. The glucose is converted to hexose phosphate and NAD is reduced to NADH.
2. The rest of glycolysis takes place as usual.
3. After glycolysis the pyruvate produced is decarboxylated (producing carbon dioxide) into ethanal.
4. The enthanal is given a hydrogen by NADH to form ethanol and the NAD can be used again.

*In animals:*

* Lactic acid is produced.

1. The reduced NAD from glycolysis in this situation gives up its hydrogen atom to the pyruvate.
2. This causes the pyruvate to be reduced into lactate (lactic acid).
3. The NAD can be used again in glycolysis.

**Note:** At the point where aerboic respiration can start again the lactic acid will be broken down by the liver and converted into glycogen as an energy store for future use.

## Budget for Energy

* In glycolysis a net total of two ATP molecules is produced.
* Glycolysis also produces two reduced NAD molecules which have the potential to produce six more molecules of ATP through aerobic respiration.

* The link reaction also produces two molecules of reduced NAD which have the potential to produce six molecules of ATP.

* Krebs cycle produces enough reduced carrier to from twenty-four molecules of ATP of which two are made from substrate level phosphorylation.

<strong>The total amount of ATP produced from just one molecule of glucose is thrity-eight.</strong>

## Respiratory Substrates

* Sometimes a different respiratory substrate than glucose is used.
* Both proteins and fats can also be used as alternative respiratory substrates.

!SLIDE

## Respiratory Substrates
#### Fats


* Fats are used as an energy store in many orgainisms and can also be used as a respiratory substrate when levels of carbohydates of which glucose is an example fall too low.
* the lipid has to be split into its individual components; glycerol and three fatty acids. This is done by hydrolysis.
* The glycerol is then converted into a three carbon sugar.
* This 3C sugar then enters through triose phosphate.
* Remaining fatty acid chains are long and can be broken down into a number of two carbon fragments which enter the respiration pathway as acetly CoA.

** One gram of fat certainly releases more that two times the energy of one gram of carbohydrate.**

## Respiratory Substrates
#### Proteins

* Proteins can be used as a respiratory substate only in extreme circumstances e.g. starvation.

1. The protein is first converted into the amino acids that make it up through the process of hydrolysation
2. It then travels to the liver where it is deaminated, that is the amine groups of the amino acids are removed.
3. The removed amine groups are converted into urea and excreted and the residue is converted into either acetyl CoA, pyruvate or another intermediary.
4. This then enters the Krebs Cycle.

<strong>Proteins are only used as a last resort.</strong>
