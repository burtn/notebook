## Resistance

> Resistance is the ability of an organism to survive exposure to harmful chemicals which would normally kill them.

* An example of resistance is found in rats which are becoming resistant to Warfarin, an aticoagulant poison used frequently to curb rat populations.

!SLIDE

## Resistance
#### Warfarin

* Warfarin resistance is conferred to the rat by the domminant R allele.
* Warfarin resistance comes with an increased need in vitamin K.
* Homozygous rats require too much Vitamin K for them to possible obtain from their environment.
* Heterozygous rats require only a small amount of vitamin K. They have an advantage over Homozygous and non-resistant rats.

## Resistance
#### MRSA

* Meticillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria which has developed resistance to penicillins like meticillin.
* Meticillin is a commonly used antibiotic in hospitals.
* The resitance arose from random mutations in the bacteria population.
* The bacteria break down the antibiotic with enzymes such as penicillinase which breaks down peniciillin.
* Possessing this enzymes is an advantages to the selection pressure, use of the antibiotics.
* The quantity and frequency of the antibiotic usage changes the selection pressure.

* When bacteria sexually reproduce (conjugation) resistance can be passed between the organisms on plasmids.
* Only between members of the same species!

!SLIDE

## Resitance
#### Agriculture

* Farm animals are commonly kept in a confined space making desease transmission easier.
* Broad spectrum antibiotics are added to animal feed to prevent disease but in fact allows resistance to develop.

!SLIDE

## Artificial Selection

> Atrificial selection (selective breeding) makes use of the natural variations that occur within a population to produce the best organisms possible.

* Artificial selection mimics natural selection but happens at an accelerated rate.
* It can take many years to produce organisms which have the desired characteristics. 
* These organisms are of the same species as their relatives but are often called *breeds* in animals and *varieties* in plants.

* There are two ways in which artificial selection can occur.

!SLIDE

## Artificial Selection
#### Methods

* Inbreeding - the gametes of close relatives fuse.
	* Disadvantages include inbreeding depression, Inbreeding depression occurs because inbreeding favours homozygosity.

> Homozygosity means that the chance of a recessive allele expressing itself through a double recessive individual increases. 

* Outbreeding - introduces new genes and undoes damage caused by outbreeding.
* Hybrid vigour or heterosis in which organisms have improved function in a hybrid offspring is caused by outbreeding.

!SLIDE

## Biodiversity
#### Extinction

> Humans have a large impact in biodiversity both negatively e.g. driving species to extinction and positively e.g. species conservation programs.

* Extinction is a natural process.
* The concern is that extinctions occur at a much increased rate now in comparison with the background rate which scientists believe is the normal rate at which extinction would be occurring.
* The background rate is said to be 1 in every 1 million species per year.
* Organisms which are 'on the brink' of extinction are said to be endangered species.

!SLIDE

## Biodiversity
#### Causes of reduction in biodiversity.

Main causes:
* Over hunting/ over fishing
* Habitat loss
* competition from other intriduced species

Other causes:
* Pollution
* Deforestation
* Destruction of wetlands 

!SLIDE

## Biodiversity
#### Importance

> Any organism has the potential to contain useful chemicals or disease fighting genes.

* To protect species conservation work is carried out.

> Species conservation is the planned preservation of wildlife.

!SLIDE

## Biodiversity
#### Conservation Steps

Many steps have been taken in a bid to conserve species including...

* Storage of seeds in seed banks
* Sperm banks
* Caring of older breeds through 'rare breed societies'
* various pieces of legislation such as CITES (<small>Legislation like CITES can be used to prevent over-fishing, over-hunting, plant collecting and egg collecting.</small>)
* reintroduction programmes
* Breeding programmes
* Public awareness campaigns
* Ecotourism

> Ecotourism is responsible travel to places which have natural environments that are in need of conservation and which the tourism improves the well being of the local [human] population.

Goals of ecotourism:

* Contributing to conservation
* Employing local people
* Giving back to the community
* co-operation with local people
* educating the visitors as well as the local people 

!SLIDE

## Biofuels

> A biofuel is any fuel which has a biological origin. 

Examples include:

* Ethanol - from sugar cane
* Oilseed rape oil (as biodiesal)

!SLIDE

## Biofuels
#### Advantages

* More environmentall friendly
* Less CO2 emissions
* Crops take CO2 from air

**Biofuels however are not entirely biologically friendly because they require farming, processing and other treatment which can make them as polluting as their petroleum based counterparts.**

Currently plant production is a limiting factor to biofule adoption. This is because only a small part of the plant can be used.

!SLIDE

## Carbon Cycle

* Human activity directly impacts the carbon cycle.
* In the past there has been a dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
* Fossil fuel combustion accounts for 70% of the increase in CO2.
* Deforestation accounts for the remaining 30% increase in carbon dixoide levels.
* 50% af the worlds forest have been removed in under 30 years
* Forests usuall maintain carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere through photosynthesis.
* It is important that carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the atmosphere are balanced because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.

!SLIDE

## Carbon Cycle
#### Global Warming

> Global warming leads to changes in climate including changes in patterns of rainfall and rises in the level of seas.

* Sea level rises caused by the melting of polar icecaps can cause flooding in low lying regions.
* Forest fires, cyclones (and tropical cyclones aka hurricanes) as well as prolonged drought can also be caused.

* In a bid to fight global warming ongoing genetic engineering research is being carried out to develop drought resistant crops.

!SLIDE

## Deforestation

* 35% of the earths surface is covered in forest.
* This number is rapidly decreasing.
* Under normal circumstances a forest can regenerate naturally or be replanted artificially to make up for felled trees however tree felling now happens so fast that woodlands are being cut down faster than they can be replaced.

!SLIDE

## Deforestation
#### Forests as an Ecosystem

Forests are a very important ecosystem. Because they consist primarily of large plants (trees) they help maintain the balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.

!SLIDE

## Exploitation through farming

* Farminng is becoming increasinly more advanced and efficient in order to keep up with human food consumption.

Since the end of WWII:
* Mechanisation has been introduced to farming.
* Fertiliser usage has soared.
* Pesticide usage has soared.

!SLIDE

#### Impacts of mechanisation

* To get machinery into the field hedgerows had to be removed.
* In the large fields farmers tended to only grow one crop such as wheat or maize. (a monoculture)

> Monoculture is the growing of a large number of crops which are of a simplar type as well as age and that are grown simultaneously.

* Monocultures result in reduced species diverity and in the long term lead to decreased year on year yield.

!SLIDE

#### Impacts of fertiliser and pesticide usage

* Mineral depletion.
* Attraction of pests to large crop supplies (from fertiliser).
* More crop related diseases.
* Increase agricultural run off leading to eutrophication.

!SLIDE

## Exploitation through farming
#### Changes to farming

* People have become far more aware and protective of 'their' countryside.
* Farmers have been ecouraged to manage their farms to increase biodiversity
	* Through grants for conservation efforts etc.
* Passing of the Environment act the UK government reversed the removal of hedgerows.
	* Hedges act as wildlife corridors which allow animals to move between different areas of woodland which also maintains the woodland biodiversity.
	* Hedges also provide habitats and nesting sites for a wide range or birds and animals.

!SLIDE

## Fertillisers

* The effects of the fertiliser use are due to excess nitrate in the soil.
* The excess nitrates can be used be weed plants such as grasses and nettles which grow taller and faster covering smaller plants so that they do not receive enough sunlight.
* Excess nitrates can also run off into water bodies.
* Leaching results in eutrophication of lakes and rivers.

**There is strict legislation aimed at tackling excessive fertiliser use:**

* Forcing farmers to restrict the amount of fertiliser they use.
* Forcing farmers to restrict the time when they use fertiliser.
* Adds 10 metre clear strips by any watercourse and drainage ditches.

!SLIDE

## Overfishing

> Overfishing can be loosely defined as the rate of fishing exceeding the rate at which fish breed.

####Â Comercial Fishing Techniques

* Drift netting
	* Used to catch pelagic fish which inhabit the upper parts of the water.
	* The size of the fish caught by this method is dependant on the size of the mesh of the net that is used.

**In some cases the fish caught are too small to sell but are dead before they are thrown back.**

* Trawling
	* Trawl nets are dragged through the water 'catching' everything in the nets path.
	* Size of the trawl net is important and in most places closely regulated so as to prevent fishermen from catching younger fish which have not yet matured enough to reproduce.

!SLIDE

## Overfishing
#### Maintaining fish stocks

* Maitenance of fish stocks is important in maintaining the fishermens livelihoods.

#### Methods

* Restricting mesh size
* Quotas on the size of catches.
* Exclusion zones
* closed/open seasons.

**All of these methods require an amount of enforcement to be effective which can be costly.**

!SLIDE

## Overfishing
#### Effects of overfishing

* Overfishing of organisms lower in the food chain reduces the population size of those further up.

!SLIDE

## Overfishing
#### Farming

* Fish can grow very well in warm waters discharged from factories as well as in ponds, lakes and estuaries in which they live in enclosures.
* These enclosures are managed and have predators removed abd food supplies maintained at an optimum level through the addition of artificial fertilisers which aid phytoplankton growth. These phytoplanton are later eaten by the fish which are being farmed.

!SLIDE

#### Problems w/ farming

* Disease can easily spread between the fish.
* Disease can spread into wild fish populations.
* Large amounts of antibiotics have to be added to the 'farm' to keep the fish healthy
* Pesticides have to be used to kill of fish parasites.
* Pesticides can spread from the farm and harm marine invertebrates.
* Fish excreta can also spread out into the surroundings and cause eutrophication.

> Eutrophication is the sudden growth of algae/cyanobacteria due to excessive richness of nutrients in the body of water.

* Fish themselves may escape.
* Escaped fish breed with the wild stock the wild fish population can be weakened.
* Further in order to farm the fish (especially carnivorous fish like salmon) you have to have more fish in the first place.
	* Samon eat 3x their own weight in other fish.
