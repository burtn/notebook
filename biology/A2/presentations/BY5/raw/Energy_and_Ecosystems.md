## Flow of Energy

0: The source of all the energy is the sun, specifically sunlight.

1: The energy flow through an ecosystem begins with producers.

> Producers are organisms like gree plants which take energy from the sun and build sugars.

2: After producers are primary consumers (a trophic level up).

> Primary consumers are herbivores.

3: Secondary and tertiary consumers follow primary consumers.

> Secondary and tertiary consumers are carnivores.

* Usually the food chain is limited to around 4 levels, Producer -> Primary Consumer -> Seconday Consumer -> Tertiary Consumer.


4: Energy leaves the system as heat.

* Remaning energy is 'built in' to organisms over the course of their lifetime.
* This energy takes the form of organic molecules.

5: Decomposers recycle these nutrients back into the environement.

> Decomposers are microbes such as fungi which take their nutrients for faeces and dead organisms

## Succession

> A succession is the change that occurs in a comunity in terms of its composition and structure over time.

* Primary succession refers to when the different species that make up the commnunity are introduced or begin to colonise the area.
* Secondary succession refers to when organisms are reintroduced into an area which has previously supported a community.

Over time species diversity in the community gradually increases until such time as a table state is reached.

* This stable state is known as a **climax community** 
* In the UK Oak woodland is often the climax community.

## Communities

> A Community is the different populations of species which can be found living in a habitat.

* Ecosystems are dynamic - they don't remain the same indefinitley.
* When the environment changes it has a direct impact on the organims which inhabit it.

* When a group of organisms colonise a new environment they are referred to as a pioneer comunity.
* A climax comunity is one which has reached an equilibreum point in relation to its environment.
* The climax comunity usually consists of long lived plants and animals.

**Note: Human activity can prevent a climax community from forming.**
<small>e.g. Controlled burning, Farming, Soil erosion & deforestation.</small>

## Flow (Producers)

* Producers cannot absorb all of the suns energy however and a large amount is unabsorbed either because it is reflected or because it misses chlorophyll or just doesn't hit the plants leaves at all.
* The energy that the producer does capture from the sun is called the gross primary productivity

> GPP refers to the rate at which the products from photosynthesis are formed. 

* Net primary productivity is the energy that is not used up by the producer e.g. in respiration.
* Primary consumers can obtain the energy that is represented by the NPP

!SLIDE

## Flow (Consumers)

* Secondary productivity is the rate at which the cells cels and tissues of consumers 'build up' energy.
