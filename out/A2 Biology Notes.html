<h2>Homeostasis</h2>
<p>Homeostasis is by definition the maintaining of a consistent environment within a (living) organism. For example blood sugar concentration, kidney function and temperature are all maintained. </p>
<p>A self regulating system works on the principal of negative feedback. For any variable that needs to be controlled there is a set point which is the desired value for the variable and the one at which the system operates. This variable is monitored by a sensor which triggers when the variable deviates from the desired value. When a receptor detecs a change from the normal it despatches instructions to a co-ordinator. This co-ordinator then in turn communicates with a number of effectors which carry out processes to correct the variable. Once the corrections have been effected and the variables value is at the desired value then the sensor is informed - this causes the detector to 'reset' and the process can begin again. This is what happend in most biological control systems.</p><div id="The_Kidney">
<h2>The Kidney</h2>
<p>The kidney performs two important functions. The first is the removal of nitrogenous waste from the body. There are three forms of nitrogenous waste. Urea which comes from amino acids, Uric acid which is from Nucleic acids and Creatinine from Creatine phosphate which is an energy store in muscles.</p>
<p>In humans it is urea that is produced. This is because the amonia which is first produced is highly toxic so it is converted to urea whch is less toxic and also soluable in water so we can remove it in our urine. If we have too much protein in our diet the excess has to be broken down as we cannot store them. This happens in the liver where the amino acids which make up proteins are deamminated - removing their amine group. This forms ammonia which is quickly converted to urea so it can be removed.</p>
<p>The urea is produced by reacting deamminated amino acids with oxygen to produce ammonia which is added to carbon dioxide to crate urea. The other product of this process is Keyto acid which is converted into pyruvic acid (<strong>pyruvate</strong>) for use in respiration or is converted into fat for storage.</p>
<p>Unlike us birds produce thick urine made up of uric acid which is more complex than urea and therefore takes more energy to produce - it is also less toxic. Birds produce 'solid' urine because they carry very little water at it is heavy.</p>
<p>We have two kidneys which filter waste products from the blood. Both kidneys are made up of approximately one million uriniferous tubles which called nephrons. Each nephron contains a Bowmans capsule within which is a number of capilaries known collectively as the glomerulus. Blood is supplied to the nephron through the afferent arteriole, frome the glomerulus the blood is taken by the efferent arteriole wo two other seperate capilary systems.</p>
<p>These capilary networks are the one which runs along beside the loop of henle called the vasa recta and the capillary network seriving the the proximal and distal convoluted tubles.</p><div id="Ultrafiltration">
<h2>Ultrafiltration</h2>
<p>Ultrafiltration is the process that occurs in the kidneys to remove small soluble molecules from blood plasma. It occurs under high pressure, hence the name ultrafiltration. Through ultrafiltration water, glucose, urea and various salts pass from the capilaries in the glomerulus to the Bowman's capsule. This fluid is known as glomerular filtrate or primary urine. From the Bowman's capusule the fluid passes through the proximal convoluted tubule and the loop on henle, through the distal convoluted tubule into the collecting duct. By the time the fluid reaches the collecting duct it is no longer glomerular filtrate, it is urine. </p>
<p>The blood which enters the glomerulus is seperated from the Bowman's capsule by a basement membrane through which only small molecules can pass - leaving large plasma proteins in the blood plasma. Proteins do however sometimes appear in urine - this is a symptom of high blood pressure as the pressure can force the large plasma proteins through the basement membrane. Damage to the basement membrane can also allow red blood cells into urine though it is more likely that the blood entered the urine from somewhere else.</p>
<p>The glomerulus is 'designed' specifically for ultrafiltration to take place. With the basement membrane acting as a 'seive' between the capilaries and the nephron and two cell layers. The first cell layer is the actual wall of the capilary within which there are a number of small gaps then there is the basement membrane which is sandwiched between the first layer and another layer which makes up the wall of the Bowman's capsule - this layer also has special epilthelial cells known as podocytes.</p>
<p>The pressure that allows utlrafiltration to happen is primarily supplied by the hydrostatic pressure of the blood in the capilaries of the glamerulus. This pressure is increased due to the small diameter of the efferent artiriole and also due to the water potential of the blood due to the collodial plasma proteins. This means that the pressure within the glomerulus can be varied by varying the diameter of either of the efferent or afferent arterioles.</p><div id="Reabsorption">
<h2>Reabsorption</h2>
<p>Of all the materials which were originally removed from the blood through ultrafiltration only all of the glucose is reabsorbed most of the salts and water are also reabsorbed into the blood. What is left over is urine which passes to the bladder. </p>
<p>This process occurs as the glomerular filtrate flows through the nephron. The glucose and water are reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule though a small amount of water is also reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule along with some salts. Any remaining water is absorbed by the collecting duct in a process with the loop of Henle. Glucose and salts are reabsorbed by active transport whilst the water is passively absorbed by osmosis after the salt is removed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the loop of Henle is to collectively concentrate salts in the medula of the kidney, specifically within the tissue fluid. This high concentration of salt then causes an osmotic flow of water which passes from the collecting ducts. This acts to concentrate the urine and make it hypertonic in comparison with the blood. The loop of Henle works on a principle known as the hair-pin counter-current multiplier. As the fluid flows through the ascending limb of the loop sodium and chlorine ions are pumped from the limb to the surrounding medula thereby creating a low water potential at the apex of the loop. Because the ascending limp is impmermeable to water relative to the descending limb water leaves the glomerular filtrate from the descending limb at which point it is taken away by blood in the vasa recta. This causes the fluid in the descending limb to become more and more concentrated and the fluid flowing through the ascending limb to become more and more dilute. Altogether the large number of loops create a region of low water potential in the medula so that as the collecting ducts carrying urine pass through the medulla water passes out through osmosis allowing the counter current mechanism to act as a fine control for osmoregulation.</p>
<p>In the proximal convoluted tubule the cells are adapted for absorbtion by having microvilli and a large number of mitochondria. The large number of mitochndria are required to provide <strong>ATP</strong> (from respiration which takes place within the mitochondrion) for active transport whilst the microvilli create a large surface area over which absorbtion can take place.</p><div id="Osmoregulation">
<h2>Osmoregulation</h2>
<p>Osmoregulation is the homeostatic control of body water. Like most of the processes involved in homeostasis osmoregulation relies an a system of negative feedback. There are several components to the system, the first is the receptors responsible for detecting the change in water level - these are located in the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Second is the posterior lobe of the pituitary which acts as the co-ordinator of the system and thirdly the collecting ducts of the kidneys which are the effectors; acting to change the water level.</p>
<p>Like the walls of the distal convoluted tubule the permiability of the collecting ducts can also be controlled by hormones. This hormone control alongside the build up of hypertonic (interstitial) fluids in the medulla from the loop of Henle is the factor which controlls wether or not the body releases hypertonic or hypotonic urine.</p>
<p>ADH is the hormone which controlls the permeability of the collecting duct walls. It makes the walls permeable so that water is reabsorbed. The result of this is that the urine has a concentration which is similar to that of other body fluids, i.e. it is hypertonic to them. Water reabsorption is controlled by a feedback system, negative feedback acts to restore the normal osmotic concentration should the blood become more diluted or similarly if it becomes more concentrated.</p>
<p>There are several things that may cause a drop in the water potential of blood, excessive sweating, high salt intake and reduced water consumption. The level of salt (sodium chloride) in the blood is an indication of the volume of water in the body, it it this that the hypothalamus is sensitive to. If the water level in the blood is low osmotic receptors detect the drop in water potential which triggers nerve impulses which travel to the posterior pituitary gland. As a result of the nerve impulses the gland releases ADH into the blood. The ADH increases the distal convoluted tubule's and the collecting duct's permeability to water. This increase in permeability means more water is reabsorbed from these tubules into the region of high solute concentration found in the medulla from where it is reabsorbed into the blood such that the small volume of urine eventually released is concentrated.</p><div id="Adaptations_for_Environments">
<h2>Adaptations for Environments</h2>
<p>Different animals produce different types of nitrogenous waste and so have different waste disposal mechanisms. The animals environment has a large role in the type of nitrogenous waste that is produced. For example aquatic organisms such as fish produce ammonio which is higly toxic to us and also to fish however since fish are surrounded by water the ammonia can diffuse out of the fish across the gills where it is quickly diluted to a safe level.</p>
<p>Birds and insects on the other hand excreate uric acid which is amost entirely insoluable. It is also non-toxic unlike ammonia and urea. It does however have a large energy 'cost' associated with the process which produces it. The advantage to the bird is that litle to no water is required for it to be excreted. This is important as it means that the animal can survive in dry environments and conserve water. For birds it also makes them lighter as the have to carry less heavy water around.</p>
<p>Mammals such as ourselves excrete urea in our urine. To produce urea does require energy but not as much as that which is required to produce uric acid. It is also less toxic than the ammonia which fish produce and so it can be kept in our tissues in higher concentrations albeit for only short periods of time.</p>
<p>In order for mammals to live in deserts and other arid conditions they have adapted to have the loop of Henle which has a large role in water absorption (see reabsorption in earlier in this section). The longer a mammals loop of Henle the greater the solute concentration that can build up in the medula and also the greater amount of water that can be reabsorbed. The result is highly concentrated urine. Some mammals like the kangaroo rat have particularly long loops of Henle. </p>
<p>To survive with little or even no water some animals must depend upon metabolic water. This metabolic water is produced by the breakdown of food reserves during respiration. Alonside this desert animals live underground during the day, their burrows are cool and humid so they lose less water through evaporation.</p><h3> Keywords </h3><ul><li>Nitrogen</li></ul><ul><li>Carbon</li></ul><ul><li>saprobionts</li></ul><ul><li>fossil rules</li></ul><ul><li>nucleic acid</li></ul><ul><li>putrifaction</li></ul><ul><li>nitrification</li></ul><ul><li>Denitrification</li></ul><div id="The_Carbon_Cycle">
<h2>The Carbon Cycle</h2>
<p>The carbon cycle is the flow of carbon through living organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is added to the air by the respiration of animals, micro-organisms and plants and naturally the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.</p>
<p>For plants however the process of photosynthesis uses up a large amount (almost all) of the carbon dioxide that is released by the plant into the atmosphere. Plants use carbon for the production of carbohydrates, fats and proteins which contributes to plant growth and therefore animal growth as we move up the food chain.</p>
<p>When plants and animals die their dead 'bodies' are acted on by saprobionts. Saprobionts are micro-organisms which optain their food from the decaying remains of other organisms. These are found in the soil and release carbond dioxide as a gas back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>For a long time the level of carbon dioxide globally in the atmosphere has risen. This is mainly because of human activities like burning fossil fules and deforestation which removes a large number of photosynthesising species so less carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere.</p><div id="The_Nitrogen_Cycle">
<h2>The Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
<p>Like the carbon cycle the nitrogen cycle is the flow of nitrogen (both organic and inorganic) through organisms and their environment. Within the cycle there is an interchange between nitrogenous compounds which are solid an gaseous atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is used within living organisms to make amino acids which in turn are built up into proteins. Nitrogen is also used to produce nucleic acids; DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>Since neither plants nor animals can make use of gaseous nitrogen they must get their nitrogen souce from a different compound. Plants get their nitrogen by taking in nitrates in solution through their roots. The organic nitrogen which is then produced by plants is transferred to other organisms in the food chain when the plants are are eaten by animals.</p>
<p>As with carbon when plants and animals die the nitrgen remains 'locked' in their bodies and so must be decomposed along with excrement in order to release the nitrogen back into the soil.</p>
<p>The first process in the nitrogen cycle is Putrifaction. Putrifaction is where bactera and fungi (which are decomposers) break down dead plants, animals and their excretory products into ammonium ions (which is why the process is sometimes also referred to as ammonification. Following this the amonia is converted into nitrates (though nitrites) in the process of nitrification. Examples of the involved bacteria include Nitrosomonas which converts ammonium to nitrite and Nitrobacter which converts nitrite to nitrate. Both of these conversions require aerobic conditions.</p>
<p>The atmospheric nitrogen can also be converted straight into nitrogen compounds through a number of Nitrogen fixation methods. One is Lightning but there is also free living bacteria like Azotobacter which account for the majority of nitrogen fixation. Another bacteria is the symbiotic Rhizobium which is found in legumes (beans, peas and clover) which provide nitrogen to the plant as well as releasing some back into the soil.</p>
<p>Nitrogen can also be released back into the atmosphere through denitrification whcih involves more bacteria this time in anaerobic conditions like water logged soil. Pseudomonas is one such bacteria that can reduce nitrates and ammonium (ions) back into nitrogen.</p>
<p>We can however improve nitrogen ciculation through our farming practices. Planing clover fields encourages nitrogen fixation while plouging feilds aerates the soil to create aerobic conditions. Similarly draining land that is water logged reduces anerobic conditions too. Farmers can also use the large amount of animal waste from the rearing of livestock as manure.</p>
<p>There are other ways that we can improve nitrogen too. We can fix atmospheric nitrogen ourselves using the haber process to convert it into fertiliser. More microorganisms can also be used for making compost and finally sewage disposal increases the supply of organic nitrogen.</p><h3> Keywords </h3><ul><li><strong>ATP</strong></li></ul><ul><li>activation energy</li></ul><ul><li><strong>ADP</strong></li></ul><ul><li>phoshorylation</li></ul><ul><li>enzyme</li></ul><ul><li>substrate</li></ul><ul><li>glucose</li></ul><div id="<strong>ATP</strong>_Structure">

<h2><strong>ATP</strong> Importance</h2>
<p>If the body released energy from glucose in a manner which was not controlled then it would cause
cell death. This is because the uncontrolled increase in temperature leads to an increase in
temperature which destroys cells.</p>
<p>To overcome this issue organisms use gradual energy release in order to produce <strong>ATP</strong>. To do this <strong>ADP</strong>
is converted to <strong>ATP</strong> by the addition of a phosphate molecule. This process also uses up energy so the
reaction is refered to as endergonic. The amount of energy needed to add a phosphate molecule to <strong>ADP</strong>
is 30 kJ per mol, these phosphate groups are held together by high energy bonds.</p>
<p>Reversing this process is what realeases enery - the <strong>ATP</strong> can be hydrolysed into <strong>ADP</strong> and phosphate in
an exergonic reaction as energy is released. The hydrolysis of <strong>ATP</strong> into <strong>ADP</strong> is catalysed by the
enzyme <strong>ATP</strong>-ase. Removing the phosphate group releases the same amount of (free) energy as was
stored, 30 kJ per mol. When the additional phosphate is removed it can be transferred to another
molecule making it more reactive and therfore lowering the activation energy of the new molecule.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group. Here it is <strong>ADP</strong> that is phosphorylated into
<strong>ATP</strong>. In all there are three froms of phosphorylation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxidative Phosphorylation - Substrate-level phosphorylation - Photophosphorylation</li>
</ul>
<p>Oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the membranes of mitochondria in aerobic respiration. This
process also involves electron transport.</p>
<p>Photophosphorylation occurs on the membranes of chloroplasts since it is the type of phosphorylation
that occurs in plants. Photophosphorylation is a part of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Substrate-level phosphorylation ocurs when the phosphate groups are taken from 'donor' molecules and
transferred onto <strong>ADP</strong> to make <strong>ATP</strong>.</p><div id="<strong>ATP</strong>_Roles">
<h2><strong>ATP</strong> Roles</h2>
<p><strong>ATP</strong> is involved in a variety of biological processes from movement through muscle contraction to the
sysnthesis of materials needed by cells. It useful for creating large and complex molecules from
much smaller and far simpler ones. For example <strong>ATP</strong> is used in the synthesis of polypeptides from
amino acids and DNA from nucleotides. <strong>ATP</strong> is also used in active transport because it requires
energy to move molecules up or against a <strong>concentration gradient</strong>. Specifically to change the shape of
carrier proteins in the cells plasma membrane. Cells also use <strong>ATP</strong> for secretion - the <strong>ATP</strong> is used
for the packaging of secretory products into vesicles. But <strong>ATP</strong> is also used in larget more complex
systems thatn just single cells. It is also involved in Nerve transmission, powering
sodium-potassium pumps which activley transport potassium isons across the plasma membrane.</p><div id="<strong>ATP</strong>_Uses">
<h2><strong>ATP</strong> Uses</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ATP</strong> Releases energy in small amounts when and where they are needed, conversly glucose contains
large amounts of energy that are most likeley not required immediately - this also prevents cell

<li>
<p><strong>ATP</strong> provides a common source of energy of a wide range of biological processes and chemical

<h2>Pigments in photosynthesis</h2>
<p>White light is a mixture of different wavelengths and in photosynthesis these different wavelengths
of light are trapped by a number of different pigments. There are two main types of pigments in
angiosperms (flowering plants). They are chlorophylls and carotenoids - the chlorophylls absorb
light which is primarilly in the in the red end of the spectrum whilst carotenoids absorb
wavelengths which are primarily in the blue end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The carotenoid group can be split into a further two pigments, carotenes and xanthophylls. These act
as accessory pigments as opposed to primary pigments such as chlorophyll a.</p><div id="Spectra">
<h2>Spectra</h2>
<p>The important photosynthesis spectra are the absorption spectrum and the action spectrum. Both
graphs are usually drawn together for easy comparison.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the different photosynthetic pigments absorb different wavelengths by preparing
various pigment solutions and shining a light on them. The absorption spectrum is a graph that
indicates how much light a given pigment absorbs in this situation. For example the graph shows that
chlorophyll absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum - this can be seen on the graph by the peak
at the end furthest from the y-axis. Similarly plotting the absorption spectrum for the other
pigments produces a number of graphs with peaks at different points along the spectrum. Though this
is useful for determining what wavelengths are being absorbed and by which pigments the data can not
be used to determine if a particular light wavelength is actually used in the process of
photosynthesis. A more useful graph for this purpose is the action spectrum. The action spectrum
graph shows the rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light. More specifically it could
be said that it shows the amount of carbohydrate that is produced by the plant when it is exposed to
a given wavelength of light. Since carbohydrates are an eventual product of photosynthesis it can be
used to determine which wavelenghts of light are in fact used in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The two graphs are easily compared as they are usually drawn together, if you were to compare the
two it would show a correlation between the absorption and action spectra which gives the conclusion
that the pigments are responsible for absorbing the wavelenghts of light used in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Note: It's probably better to say that the pigments absorb light 'energy' that absorb light. They
actually absorb photons which are packets of light.</p><div id="Use_the_light_luke">
<h2>Use the light luke</h2>
<p>The photons of light from the light source (more often than not - the sun) are said to be
'harvested'. This harvesting is performed by photosystems of which there are two - photosystem one
and photosystem two. These are sometimes referred to as PS700 and PS680 respectively. The numbers
refer to the peak absorption wavelength of each photosystem. Both photosystems are formed around a
molecule of chlorophyll a which is the reaction centre of the photosystem, surrounding the
chlorophyll in a 'funnel' are the accessory pigments clustered together in groups of many hundred
molecules in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. These groups are refered to as antenna
complexes. Associated with each pigment is a protein which aids in the 'funneling' of the photons in
the chloroplast. In this way the pigments pass the absorped energy from one molecule to the next
through the antenna complex until it reaches the reaction centre - a molecule of chlorophll a.</p><div id="Phase_1_-_Light_Dependant">
<h2>Phase 1 - Light Dependant</h2>
<p>The light independant phase of photosynthesis involves several sub-processes. Photolysis - which is
the splitting of water molecules using energy from photons (light) to produce hydrogen ions and
electrons. The reduction of N<strong>ADP</strong> into reduced N<strong>ADP</strong> (N<strong>ADP</strong>H) and finally the synthesis of <strong>ATP</strong> from <strong>ADP</strong>
and inorganic phosphate as in respiration. Since plants make use of light energy in this process the
type of phosphorylation is photophosphorylation.</p>
<p>The process starts when photons of light hit a photosystem they pass down to the primary pigment,
chlorophyll a. The energy from the photon excites electrons in the molecule of chlorophyll causing
them to gain energy and move to a higher energy level. This creates a movement of electrons which
can be described as the Z-scheme because the wasy the electrons change energy levels can be drawn as
a sideways Z. The <strong>ATP</strong> produced by this process is made in one of two ways much like there is aerobic
and anaerobic respiration in photosythesis there is cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation. It
is non-cyclic photophosphorylation which usually occurs.</p>
<p>Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves both photosystem one and photosystem two. Photosystem two
absorbs the photons first, the photons pass down the antenna complex to the reaction centre. This
excites two electrons form chlorophyll a into a high energy state. This allows them to be picked up
by electron acceptors, these electrons then get passed along a chain to electron carriers to
photosystem one. On the way to photosystem one they also pass through a proton pump passing some of
their energy to the pump as well as losing energy to each electron acceptor. The energy lost by the
electrons along this chain is used to synthesise <strong>ATP</strong> from <strong>ADP</strong>. Photosystem one also absorbes some
photons of light - again causing the excitement of two electrons into a higher energy state and
allowing them to be accepted by another electron acceptor. Because photosytem two lost electrons at
the start of the process the molecule of chlorophyll a in its reaction centre is now unstable, in
order to restabalise the molecule electrons from photolysis (the splitting of water) are used.
Photolysis casuses water to be split into hydrogen, oxygen and elecrons.</p>
<p>The electron acceptor which receieved electrons from photosystem one releases some of its electrons
to the Hydrogen ions which are found outside the thylakoid membrane. This alows them to join with
N<strong>ADP</strong> to form reduced N<strong>ADP</strong>. These electrons never return to a molecule of chlorophyll so the system
is non-cyclic.</p>
<p>Cyclic phosphorylation on the other hand only makes used of photosystem one. As in non-cyclic
photophosphorylation th light energy is absorbed by the photosystem and passed to the chlorphyll a
at the reaction centre. The second electron acceptor again accepts the high energy electrons created
as a result of this, the electrons which are not used to produced reduced N<strong>ADP</strong> by passing them to
Hydrogen ions outside the thylakoid membrane are returned to photosystem one by passing along a
chain of elctron acceptors. The energy generated as a result of this 'passing around' of electrons
is used to synthesise <strong>ATP</strong>.</p>
<p>Note though that cyclic photophosphorylation does not produced reduced N<strong>ADP</strong>.</p>
<p>All the reactions of the light dependant phase of photosynthesis occur within the thylakoid membrane
of the chloroplast. As the elctrons are moving from one photosystem to another they pass though a
proton pump which pumps protons from within the stroma across the membrane and into the thylakoid
space. Like in respiration this creates an electrochemical gradient because of the build up of
hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space. This electrochemical gradient forces hydrogen ions to diffuse
back across the membrane through protein channels which provides energy to the <strong>ATP</strong> synthase to
produce <strong>ATP</strong> from <strong>ADP</strong> and phosphate. The <strong>ATP</strong> as well as the N<strong>ADP</strong> that is produced in this phase is
used later on in the light dependant phase also.</p><div id="Phase_2_-_Light_Independant">
<h2>Phase 2 - Light Independant</h2>
<p>The light independant phase of photosynthesis makes used of the products from the light dependant
phase - <strong>ATP</strong> and N<strong>ADP</strong>. It occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and involves a series of enzyme
catalysed reactions which use <strong>ATP</strong> as a source of energy and N<strong>ADP</strong> to reduce carbon dioxide in order
to synthesise hexose sugar.</p>
<p>The light indpendant stage of photosynthesis is often referred to as the calvin cycle and was
discovered by a scientist called Calvin and his associates Benson and Bassham using radioactive
carbon 14 and the alga Chlorella. The cycle starts with a five carbon molecule called RuBP which
acts as an acceptor molecule combining with carbon dioxide to form an unstable six carbon compound
in a reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCo. Because this six carbon compound is unstable
it splits immediately into two molecules of GP. This molecule of GP is the phosphorylated by <strong>ATP</strong> and
reduced by N<strong>ADP</strong> into triose phosphate (TP). Some of the TP can be removed from the cycle and built
into glucose phosphate and starch by condensation. However in order for the cycle to continue some
of the TP must be reused. This is done by regnerating RuBP from the TP through a series of <strong>ATP</strong>
powered reactions. The N<strong>ADP</strong> is also remade and returns to the light dependant phase so that it can
be reduced, and the reused again.</p><div id="Synthesis">
<h2>Synthesis</h2>
<p>The TP that is removed from the light indepedant phase of photoysnthesis (the calvin cycle) is
metabolised into a number of products such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids with which the
plant can make all the chemicals it needs to live. However some inorganic ions which are nutrients
needed by the plant can be a limiting factor in metabolism should they become in short supply.</p>
<p>Macronutrients such as magnesium, calcium and nitrogen are also required are needed in small
amounts. Micronutrients such as copper and manganese are needed in much smaller amounts.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is taken into the plant by the roots in the form of nitrates. These nitrates are
transported in the xylem and as amino acids in the phloem. Nitrogen is used for the synthesis of
proteins and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. If a plant has a nitrogen deficiency it shows symptoms
such as reduced growth and chlorosis. Chlorosis is the yellowing of the leaves caused by a drop in
chlorophyll production. (Chlorosis appears first in old leaves). Magnesium forms part of the
chlorophyll molecule and is absorbed as magnesium ions. All of the plants tissues require magnesium
because it also actives <strong>ATP</strong>ase - it is transported as ions in the xylem. Magnesium defficiency can
also lead to chlorosis which occurs between the veins of old leaves because exisiting magnesium is
diverted towards newly formed leaves where it can be best put to use.</p><h3> Keywords </h3><ul><li>immigrate</li></ul><ul><li>emigrate</li></ul><ul><li>lag phase</li></ul><ul><li>exponential phase</li></ul><ul><li>stationary phase</li></ul><ul><li>death phase</li></ul><ul><li>density dependant</li></ul><ul><li>density independant</li></ul><ul><li>pesticides</li></ul><ul><li>resistance</li></ul><div id="Controlling_Population_Growth">
<h2>Controlling Population Growth</h2>
<p>At any time, for any population the size of the population is found from the birth rate and death rate (though also organisms can immigrate into the population or emmigrate out).</p>
<p>When a species encouters an area which it can colonise it grows following the S shaped curve which is typical for any new species. The S shape is caused by three components of the population growth. The first is the lag phase - when a species first starts to colonise an area there are few individuals so growth is slow and the organisms must adapt and prepate to grow for example by synthesising enzymes and other metabolic activity. Following the lag phase is the exponential phase. The exponential phase occurs as the populations number increases and as long as their is no factor which might limit population growth more and more of the population starts to reproduce this causes the popultion to grown exponentially like an e^x graph - though this can not be continued forever. Eventually the population has to stop growing, when it does it enters the stationary phase. During this phase the number of births is equal to the number of deaths and the population has reached its largest possible size. The largest size population can reach in an environment is known as the carrying capacity of that environment. After the stationary phase is the death phase, this is when the death rate is greater than the birth rate - it usually occurs when all the food has been used up.</p>
<p>The environment can also 'resist' population growth. This resistance includes a number of factors which affect population size such as disease, the weather or the build up of toxic waste. All of these factors slow down poulation growth.</p>
<p>Some factors may also cause the population to 'crash' such as density independant factors which affect all the organisms in an environment regardless of the population size. These effects are usually caused by a sudden change in an abiotic factor like the breakout of a wildfire. Other factors are those which are density dependant and whose effect increases along with the size of the population. One such example of this is the loss of a food supply. The carrying capacity of the environment as mentioned above is caused by density dependnt factors.</p>
<p>Naturally populaton sizes vary rather than remain constant. Whilst these variations are not often large and do not occur at random intervals then the population size of a species remains close to an equilibreum position - this is the carrying capacity of the environment and if the populations numbers increase above this value then a density dependant factor acts to limit the population growth either by increasing the death rate or reducing breeding rate. When the population falls back below the equilibreum position the density dependatn factor no longer affects the growth rate allowing the number to increse once again. Population variations usually occur in line with another pattern such as the season cycle (Spring - Summber - Autumn - Winter) or amount of rainfall. Therefore it is said that population variation is a process regulated by negative feedback.</p>
<p>Negative feedback is where a monitored variable changes causing a reponse to be triggered and the result of the response counteracts the action which first affected the monitored variable.</p><div id="Competition">
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>In an environment plants and animals often have to struggle to survive. For plants the competition is often for space and nutrients (including water) as well as light. Animals also compete for space along with food and shelter. Often animals are also in competition for mates. </p>
<p>There are two different types of competition. Interspecific competition and Intraspecific competition. The later is competition between individuals which are members of the same species. Such competition is dependant on density as when the population increases more members of the population do not survive. This is important because most organisms produce far more offspring than their habitat can support. If an organism is better adapted then it is more likely to win the competition and so survive.</p>
<p>Interspecific competion on the other hand occurs between members of a different species. Collectively each species occupies a given niche, this is the role that it carries out in the environment as well as the space it takes up. Two species can not occupy the same niche, one has to win.</p><div id="Fighting_Pests">
<h2>Fighting Pests</h2>
<p>A pest is any organisms which competes with or adversly affects a population of organisms that are important economically. These pests are usually fought with pesticides, these are chemicals which are used to control organisms which spread disease such as mosquitos or those which damage farmers crops.</p>
<p>When pests attack crops and animals the result is a reduction in yeild and a devistating economic loss to the farmer whose crops or animals were attacked. These pests are constantly competing with crop organisms for resources and can cause desease in 'helpful' organisms which usually live on the crop. They often make infection through pathogens more likely and can spoil food which is in transit or whilst the food is in storage. </p>
<p>If a pest is causing a large amount of because it is present in very large numbers then it is worth the farmers while to spend money on controlling the pest.</p>
<p>When controlling pests either of chemical or biological control can be used. Chemical control is the use of pesticides or insecticides which are designed to kill insects (or less commonly herbicides and fungicides) , this method has both its advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<p>The advantages of chemical control are that it is very effective - the pests population is controlled very quickly and at a comparitively low cost. It can also be applied on a small scale such as just one of the farmers fields. The chemicals can be sprayed onto the crop or applied as smokes in enclosed areas, even powders. The chemicals can also be applied to animals by being added to animal feed or sprayed directly onto the animal itself. None of these application methods require a high level of skill or understanding, another advantage.</p>
<p>There are a number of disadvantes as well. A big problem when using pesticides is that the pest you are attempting to control can become resistant to the pesticide. This is where the organism becomes able to survive a dose of the chemical which would under normal conditions be lethal. Over exposure the these chemicals can also be hazardous to humans as well. Generally the chemicals which are used as pesticides are not specific enough and therfore can also kill off 'helpful' insects such as bees. They can also kill fish, birds and mamals by contamination of the food chain.</p>
<p>Likewise the use of biological controls where the interspecific competition between a predator and it's prey is used to control the pest population also has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Firstly biological control can repair some of the damage done by chemical control methods such as allowing a resurgence of 'helpgul' species. They are also usually highly specific to one pest (with the notable exception of the cane toad). In order to work correctly biological control methods must target one pest and not do any other damage to the ecosystem. Unlike chemical control biological control can also provide a long term pest control solution provided that a population equilibreum becomes established. This makes them suited to a wide range of environments including greenhouses (glasshouses). However unlike chemical control biological methods have high initial reasearch cost so in the short term is an expensive solution though it becomes cheaper as time passes.</p>
<p>The cost of biological control is also a disadvantage because of the frequent input needed to attain a balance and the high level of skill and knowledge required - such as knowing the detailed knowledge of the pests life cycle. This is due to the potential to release an organism (like the cane toad) which can itself become a pest after it exhausts its food supply or causes damage to the ecosystem. Because of this there are only a few success stories and we do not know the control agent for a large number of our existing pest problems.</p>
<p>Biological controls are also currently of litte use to individuals except for in greenhouse/glasshouse scenarios because biological control introduction needs to be carried out on a large scale.</p>
<p>Biological controls work because the abundance of prey is a factor limiting the number of its predators, in a given food chain the predator-prey relationship causes the population of both predator and prey to vary. We have been making use of this relationship to control pests. A benificial organism is released as a predator to the undesirable pest. The aim of biological control is to reduce the pest population to a sensible level at which they no longer cause any economic damage. Sometime insect parasites are used and sometimes microorganisms are used. Pests have always been regulated by their natural predators (they can have several) however through farming we have upset the system e.g. by creating large fields and removing hedges which reduced or in some cases removes the natural habitat for predators.</p>
<p>Due to both methods having a number of advantages and disadvantages it is often considered that the best solution is to use a combination of biological and chemical control even though there have been some improvement in chemical pesticides like pyrethroids and organophosphates. These combined methods include producing pest resistant crops, chainging cultivation techniques and the use of highly targeted chemicals. Such a solution is often refered to as an integrated pest control solution.</p><div id="Homeostasis_(Recap)">

<h2><strong>Glycolysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Glycolysis</strong> is the first stage of respiration and it occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The glucose
molecule is firstly combined with two <strong>ATP</strong> molecules to form hexose phosphate. This 'activates' the
glucose and makes in more reactive. The hexose phosphate is then split into two molecules of triose
phosphate. Triose phospahte is a three carbon sugar whilst hexose phosphate is a six carbon
molecule.</p>
<p>Then the triose phosphate is converted into <strong>pyruvate</strong> through the removal of hydrogen. The removed
hydorgen reduced a molecule of <strong>NAD</strong> to form reduced <strong>NAD</strong> which is often written as <strong>NAD</strong>H. I doing this
enough energy is released for the synthesis of four <strong>ATP</strong> molecules, this <strong>ATP</strong> is formed by substrate
level phosphorylation. However the net gain of <strong>ATP</strong> molecules as a result of <strong>Glycolysis</strong> is only two
as two <strong>ATP</strong> molecules are required at the begining of the process to atctivate glucose.</p>
<p>The molecules of <strong>NAD</strong>H that are produced during glycolysis have the potential to produce six further
molecules of <strong>ATP</strong> provided that the conditions for aerobic respiration are maintained.</p><div id="<strong>Link</strong>_Reaction">
<h2><strong>Link</strong> Reaction</h2>
<p>After glycolysis energy is still stored in the <strong>pyruvate</strong> molecules that are produced as a result of
glycolysis. This energy however can only be released in aerobic respiration and through the <strong>Krebs</strong>
cycle. To join together the <strong>Krebs</strong> cycle and glycolysis there is another reaction called <strong>Link</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Link</strong> reaction <strong>pyruvate</strong> diffuses from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix where it is
first <strong>decarboxylated</strong> before it is <strong>dehydrogenated</strong>. Decarboxylation is the removal of carbon dioxide
and dehydorgenation is the removal of hydrogen. The hydrogen released from the <strong>dehydrogenation</strong> of
<strong>pyruvate</strong> is accpeted by <strong>NAD</strong> to form reduced <strong>NAD</strong> (<strong>NAD</strong>H).</p>
<p>This forms a two carbon acetate which binds with coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A. It is the
Acetly CoA which enters the <strong>Krebs</strong> cycle.</p><div id="<strong>Krebs</strong>_Cycle">
<h2><strong>Krebs</strong> Cycle</h2>
<p>The <strong>acetyl CoA</strong> from glycolysis enters the <strong>Krebs</strong> cycle by combining with the four carbon acid RuBP to
form a six carbon compound. As a result of this reaction the CoA is regenerated so that it can be
used again (binding with acetate in the link reaction). This six carbon compound which is produced
goes through a series of reactions during which carbond dioxide is removed (via <strong>decarboxylation</strong>) and
hydrogen is removed (via <strong>dehydrogenation</strong>). As a result of the acetate fragment breaking down a four
carbon molecule is left over which is converted in order to regenerate the original four carbon RuBP
which combines with more <strong>acetyl CoA</strong> to keep the kerbs cycle going.</p>
<p>Two steps in the cycle involve <strong>decarboxylation</strong> whislt their are a total of four stages which involve
the <strong>dehydrogenation</strong> of a molecule. The hydrogens which are produced are 'collected' by molecules of
<strong>NAD</strong> to form three molecules of reduced <strong>NAD</strong> and also by <strong>FAD</strong> to form only one molecule of reduced <strong>FAD</strong>.</p>
<p>Altough there are a large number of steps in the krebs cycle the final amount of <strong>ATP</strong> produced in one
loop of the cycle is just one molecule. Therefore from one <strong>pyruvate</strong> molecule entering the <strong>Krebs</strong>
cycle the products are:</p>
<ul>
<li>one molecule of <strong>ATP</strong> - one molecule of reduced <strong>FAD</strong> - three molecules of reduced <strong>NAD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Note though that two <strong>pyruvate</strong> molecules are produced as a result of glycolysis so in fact two <strong>ATP</strong>
molecules of <strong>ATP</strong> are produced from glycolysis products. Because two molecules of <strong>pyruvate</strong> (and
therefore two molecules of <strong>acetyl CoA</strong>) enter the cycle it is carried out twice for every one
molecule of glucose.</p>
<p>The krebs cycle only produces one molecule of reduced <strong>FAD</strong> becuase there is only one place where <strong>FAD</strong>
acts as a carrier molecule.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <strong>Krebs</strong> cycle is to allow access to the energy stored in the carbon bonds so that
<strong>ATP</strong> and reduced <strong>NAD</strong> as well as reduced <strong>FAD</strong> can be formed. Thise carrier molecules (<strong>NAD</strong> and <strong>FAD</strong>)
transport hydrogen to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they
act as triggers for the start of the elctron transport process. As a result of breaking the carbon
bonds carbon dioxide is released from the system from decarboxlylation.</p><div id="Electron_Transport">
<h2>Electron Transport</h2>
<p>Electron tranport involves the transportation of electrons through a series of pumps and carriers
which releases energy as an <strong>ATP</strong> molecule. The hydrogen atoms bound to reduced <strong>NAD</strong> and <strong>FAD</strong> are used
in the electron transport chain. <strong>NAD</strong> and <strong>FAD</strong> are in fact coenzymes. It is the electrons in the
hydrogen atoms that are the source of energy.</p>
<p>In the electron transport chain is the initial acceptor then for every two hydrogen atoms that are
brought into the system enough energy is gaineed to allow the synthesis of three <strong>ATP</strong> molecules to
occur. When <strong>FAD</strong> is the initial acceptor only two molecules of <strong>ATP</strong> are produced this is due to there
being no pump associeated with <strong>FAD</strong> so only two pumps out of a possible three are involved reducing
the amount of <strong>ATP</strong> molecules produced to the number of pumps (two).</p>
<p>In order to explain the synthesis of <strong>ATP</strong> using the electron transport chain a model known as
Chemiosmotic theory is used. This theory proposes that the energy for <strong>ATP</strong> synthesis is proviede by
an electorchemical gradient of protons across a cell membrane.</p>
<p>Chemiosmotic theory states that Hydrogen atoms first combine with <strong>NAD</strong> reducing it. This reduced <strong>NAD</strong>
then 'donates' the elctrons of the hydrogen atoms it carries to the first pump in the chain. This
reoxidises the <strong>NAD</strong> and releases protons into the matrix of the mitochondrion. The pump then pumps
the protons into the inter membrane space. The electrons with a reduced energy level are then
transferred by a carrier to the next pump along in the chain. This pump pumps more protons into the
inter membrane space causing a build up of of protins there. This high concenration builds because
the inner membrane of the mitochindrion is impenetrable to protons except for at certain points. An
example of one of these points is where the <strong>ATP</strong> synthase moleculs is located. This 'channel' formed
by the <strong>ATP</strong> synthase allows the protons to diffuse back into the matrix. It is the diffusion of
protons through this channel that causes the <strong>ATP</strong> synthase to combine inorganic phosphate molecules
with <strong>ADP</strong> in order to synthsise <strong>ATP</strong>.</p>
<p>The last pump in the elxtron transport chain has no where to move it's electrons too so instead they
are bound to oxygen which combines with some of the protons to form a molecule of water in a
reaction catalysed by an oxidase enzyme. This means that the <strong>final electron acceptor</strong> of the entire
process is oxygen, without it protons would build up in the matrix reducing the concentration
gradient between the matrix and the inter membrane space until the concentraion gradient become no
existent at which point no <strong>ATP</strong> would be produced.</p>
<p>This complete process is just phosphorylation. More specifically it is oxidative phosphorylation. It
occurs on the membranes of the mitochondrion because the membranes have a large surface area on
which the chemical reactions and processes that make up respiration can take place. It is the
cristae of the mitochondrion which is lined with <strong>ATP</strong> synthase enzymes which actually produce the
<strong>ATP</strong>.</p><div id="Anaerobic_Respiration">
<h2>Anaerobic Respiration</h2>
<p>Anaeroic respiration is the the process of respiration that occurs in conditions where there is an
absence of oxygen. Because of the absence of oxygen only glycolysis can take place. Both the link
reaction and the <strong>Krebs</strong> cycle can not be carried out this is because the reduced <strong>NAD</strong> and <strong>FAD</strong> cannot
be oxidised again - this means that they cannot pick up more hydrogen. Because of this the amount of
<strong>ATP</strong> produced from one molecule of glucose falls all the way from thirty-eight to just two.</p>
<p>The anaerobic respiration which leads to the production of ethanol occurs in some microorganisms and
also some higher plants such as watter logged root cells. The anaerobic repiration whcih leads to
the production of lactic acid occurs primarily in muscle tissue and is the resilt of heavy
excersize.</p>
<p>The first of these anaerbic conditions is useful, it takes place in yeast to produce alcohol and
carbon dioxide. This process is a fermenation. After glycolysis the <strong>pyruvate</strong> produced is
<strong>decarboxylated</strong> (producing carbon dioxide) into ethanal. <strong>NAD</strong> still accepts the hydrogen released
during glycolysis it is then transferred to the enthanal which causes it to be reduced into ethanol
- also known as alchohol.</p>
<p>The second aerobic condition produces lactic acid in muscle tissue. The second condition occurs when
not enough oxygen can reach muscle cells, this prevents them from producing the <strong>ATP</strong> they need by
aerobic respiration so they can only use the <strong>ATP</strong> produced by glycolysis. The reduced <strong>NAD</strong> from
glycolysis in this situation gives up its hydrogen atom to the <strong>pyruvate</strong> which causes it to reduced
into lactate - which is lactic acid. It is this lactic acid which causes muslcel cramps. At the
point where aerboic respiration can start again the lactic acid will be broken down by the liver and
converted into glycogen as an energy store for future use.</p><div id="Budget_for_Energy">
<h2>Budget for Energy</h2>
<p>In order to budget for the amount of energy you need it is important to know exactly how many <strong>ATP</strong>
molecules are produced from the breakdown of only one molecule of glucose.</p>
<p>In glycolysis a net total of two <strong>ATP</strong> molecules is produced. This is because two out of the maximum
four produced are resused for the initial activation of the glucose molecule. <strong>Glycolysis</strong> also
produces two reduced <strong>NAD</strong> molecules which have the potential to produce six more molecules of <strong>ATP</strong>
through aerobic respiration.</p>
<p>The link reaction produces six molecules of <strong>ATP</strong></p>
<p><strong>Krebs</strong> cycle produces twenty-four molecules of <strong>ATP</strong> of which two are made from substrate level
phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Therfore the total amount of <strong>ATP</strong> produced from just one molecule of glucose is thrity-eight.</p><div id="Respiratory_Substrates">
<h2>Respiratory Substrates</h2>
<p>Sometimes a different respiratory substrate than glucose is used. Both proteins and fats can also be
used as alternative respiratory substrates.</p>
<p>Fats are used as an energy store in many orgainisms and can also be used as a respiratory substrate
when levels of carbohydates of which glucose is an example fall too low. In order to be used the
lipid has to be split into its individual components; glycerol and three fatty acids. This is done
by hydrolysis after which the glycerol is converted into a three carbon sugar which allows it to
enter the krebs cycle through triose phosphate. The remaining fatty acid chains are long and can be
broken down into a number of two carbon fragments which enter the respiration pathway as acetly CoA.
Because the fatty acid chains can vary in length the number of <strong>ATP</strong> molecules that can be produced
also varies.</p>
<p>Because it is possible to produce such a large number of <strong>ATP</strong> molecules from a lipid one gram of fat
certainly releases more that two times the energy of one gram of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use proteins as a respiratory substrate but only in extreme circumstances. An
example of such an extreme circumstance is starvation. As a esult of starvation tissue protein is
used to supply energy as the energy provided in the diet is too little to be useful. In digestion
the protein component of food is diverted to be used as an alternative respiratory substrate. The
protein is first converted into the amino acids that make it up through the process of
hydrolysation. It then travels to the liver where it is deaminated, that is the amine groups of the
amino acids are removed. The removed amine groups are converted into urea and excreted adn the
residue is converted into either <strong>acetyl CoA</strong>, <strong>pyruvate</strong> of another of the krebs cycle intermediaries
so that it can enter the cycle. Using protein as a respiratory substrate is generally a last resort
when both carbohydrate and fat resources have run out.</p>
