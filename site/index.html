<h3 id="atp-structure">ATP Structure</h3>

<p>ATP is a nucleotide which itself is made up of an organic base, a five carbon sugar and phosphate groups.</p>

<p>Generic nucleotide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organic base</li>
  <li>Pentose sugar </li>
  <li>Phosphate groups</li>
</ul>

<p>ATP (Adenosine triphosphate)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adenine (Organic base)</li>
  <li>Ribose (Pentose sugar) </li>
  <li>three phosphate groups</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atp-importance">ATP Importance</h3>

<p>If the body released energy from glucose in a manner which was not controlled then it would cause cell death. This is because the uncontrolled increase in temperature leads to an increase in temperature which destroys cells.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue organisms use gradual energy release in order to produce ATP. To do this ADP is converted to ATP by the addition of a phosphate molecule. This process also uses up energy so the reaction is referred to as endergonic. The amount of energy needed to add a phosphate molecule to ADP is 30 kJ per mol, these phosphate groups are held together by high energy bonds.</p>

<p>Reversing this process is what releases energy - the ATP can be hydrolysed into ADP and phosphate in an exergonic reaction as energy is released. The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP is catalysed by the enzyme ATP-ase. Removing the phosphate group releases the same amount of (free) energy as was stored, 30 kJ per mol. When the additional phosphate is removed it can be transferred to another molecule making it more reactive and therefore lowering the activation energy of the new molecule.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group. Here it is ADP that is phosphorylated into ATP. In all there are three forms of phosphorylation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oxidative Phosphorylation - Substrate-level phosphorylation - Photophosphorylation</li>
</ul>

<p>Oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the membranes of mitochondria in aerobic respiration. This process also involves electron transport.</p>

<p>Photophosphorylation occurs on the membranes of chloroplasts since it is the type of phosphorylation that occurs in plants. Photophosphorylation is a part of photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs when the phosphate groups are taken from &lsquo;donor&rsquo; molecules and transferred onto ADP to make ATP.</p>

<h3 id="atp-roles">ATP Roles</h3>

<p>ATP is involved in a variety of biological processes from movement through muscle contraction to the synthesis of materials needed by cells. It useful for creating large and complex molecules from much smaller and far simpler ones. For example ATP is used in the synthesis of polypeptides from amino acids and DNA from nucleotides. ATP is also used in active transport because it requires energy to move molecules up or against a concentration gradient. Specifically to change the shape of carrier proteins in the cells plasma membrane. Cells also use ATP for secretion - the ATP is used for the packaging of secretory products into vesicles. But ATP is also used in larger, more complex systems than just single cells. It is also involved in Nerve transmission, powering sodium-potassium pumps which actively transport potassium ions across the plasma membrane.</p>

<h3 id="atp-uses">ATP Uses</h3>

<p>In using ATP as an intermediary between glucose and energy organisms benefit from several advantages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATP Releases energy in small amounts when and where they are needed, conversely glucose contains large amounts of energy that are most likely not required immediately - this also prevents cell destruction from the excess heat that the energy in glucose would produce.</li>
  <li>ATP provides a common source of energy of a wide range of biological processes and chemical reactions. This is why it is sometimes referred to as the universal energy currency. Using ATP this way increases efficiency and give more control to the cell.</li>
  <li>To release energy from glucose a large number of enzymes are needed, this is not the case with ATP for which only one enzyme is required.</li>

<h3 id="glycolysis">Glycolysis</h3>

<p>Glycolysis is the first stage of respiration and it occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The glucose molecule is firstly combined with two ATP molecules to form hexose phosphate. This &lsquo;activates&rsquo; the glucose and makes in more reactive. The hexose phosphate is then split into two molecules of triose phosphate. Triose phosphate is a three carbon sugar whilst hexose phosphate is a six carbon molecule.</p>

<p>Then the triose phosphate is converted into pyruvate through the removal of hydrogen. The removed hydrogen reduced a molecule of NAD to form reduced NAD which is often written as NADH. I doing this enough energy is released for the synthesis of four ATP molecules, this ATP is formed by substrate level phosphorylation. However the net gain of ATP molecules as a result of Glycolysis is only two as two ATP molecules are required at the beginning of the process to activate glucose.</p>

<p>The molecules of NADH that are produced during glycolysis have the potential to produce six further molecules of ATP provided that the conditions for aerobic respiration are maintained.</p>

<h3 id="link-reaction">Link Reaction</h3>

<p>After glycolysis energy is still stored in the pyruvate molecules that are produced as a result of glycolysis. This energy however can only be released in aerobic respiration and through the Krebs cycle. To join together the Krebs cycle and glycolysis there is another reaction called Link.</p>

<p>In the Link reaction pyruvate diffuses from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix where it is first decarboxylated before it is dehydrogenated. Decarboxylation is the removal of carbon dioxide and dehydrogenation is the removal of hydrogen. The hydrogen released from the dehydrogenation of pyruvate is accepted by NAD to form reduced NAD (NADH).</p>

<p>This forms a two carbon acetate which binds with coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A. It is the Acetyl CoA which enters the Krebs cycle.</p>

<h3 id="krebs-cycle">Krebs Cycle</h3>

<p>The acetyl CoA from glycolysis enters the Krebs cycle by combining with the four carbon acid RuBP to form a six carbon compound. As a result of this reaction the CoA is regenerated so that it can be used again (binding with acetate in the link reaction). This six carbon compound which is produced goes through a series of reactions during which carbon dioxide is removed (via decarboxylation) and hydrogen is removed (via dehydrogenation). As a result of the acetate fragment breaking down a four carbon molecule is left over which is converted in order to regenerate the original four carbon RuBP which combines with more acetyl CoA to keep the kerbs cycle going.</p>

<p>Two steps in the cycle involve decarboxylation whilst their are a total of four stages which involve the dehydrogenation of a molecule. The hydrogens which are produced are &lsquo;collected&rsquo; by molecules of NAD to form three molecules of reduced NAD and also by FAD to form only one molecule of reduced FAD.</p>

<p>Although there are a large number of steps in the krebs cycle the final amount of ATP produced in one loop of the cycle is just one molecule. Therefore from one pyruvate molecule entering the Krebs cycle the products are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one molecule of ATP - one molecule of reduced FAD - three molecules of reduced NAD</li>
</ul>

<p>Note though that two pyruvate molecules are produced as a result of glycolysis so in fact two ATP molecules of ATP are produced from glycolysis products. Because two molecules of pyruvate (and therefore two molecules of acetyl CoA) enter the cycle it is carried out twice for every one molecule of glucose.</p>

<p>The Krebs cycle only produces one molecule of reduced FAD because there is only one place where FAD acts as a carrier molecule.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Krebs cycle is to allow access to the energy stored in the carbon bonds so that ATP and reduced NAD as well as reduced FAD can be formed. These carrier molecules (NAD and FAD) transport hydrogen to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they act as triggers for the start of the electron transport process. As a result of breaking the carbon bonds carbon dioxide is released from the system from decarboxlylation.</p>

<h3 id="electron-transport">Electron Transport</h3>

<p>Electron transport involves the transportation of electrons through a series of pumps and carriers which releases energy as an ATP molecule. The hydrogen atoms bound to reduced NAD and FAD are used in the electron transport chain. NAD and FAD are in fact coenzymes. It is the electrons in the hydrogen atoms that are the source of energy.</p>

<p>In the electron transport chain is the initial acceptor then for every two hydrogen atoms that are brought into the system enough energy is gained to allow the synthesis of three ATP molecules to occur. When FAD is the initial acceptor only two molecules of ATP are produced this is due to there being no pump associated with FAD so only two pumps out of a possible three are involved reducing the amount of ATP molecules produced to the number of pumps (two).</p>

<p>In order to explain the synthesis of ATP using the electron transport chain a model known as Chemiosmotic theory is used. This theory proposes that the energy for ATP synthesis is provided by an electrochemical gradient of protons across a cell membrane.</p>

<p>Chemiosmotic theory states that Hydrogen atoms first combine with NAD reducing it. This reduced NAD then &lsquo;donates&rsquo; the electrons of the hydrogen atoms it carries to the first pump in the chain. This reoxidises the NAD and releases protons into the matrix of the mitochondrion. The pump then pumps the protons into the inter membrane space. The electrons with a reduced energy level are then transferred by a carrier to the next pump along in the chain. This pump pumps more protons into the inter membrane space causing a build up of of proteins there. This high concentration builds because the inner membrane of the mitochondrion is impenetrable to protons except for at certain points. An example of one of these points is where the ATP synthase molecules is located. This &lsquo;channel&rsquo; formed by the ATP synthase allows the protons to diffuse back into the matrix. It is the diffusion of protons through this channel that causes the ATP synthase to combine inorganic phosphate molecules with ADP in order to synthesise ATP.</p>

<p>The last pump in the electron transport chain has no where to move it&rsquo;s electrons too so instead they are bound to oxygen which combines with some of the protons to form a molecule of water in a reaction catalysed by an oxidase enzyme. This means that the final electron acceptor of the entire process is oxygen, without it protons would build up in the matrix reducing the concentration gradient between the matrix and the inter membrane space until the concentration gradient become no existent at which point no ATP would be produced.</p>

<p>This complete process is just phosphorylation. More specifically it is oxidative phosphorylation. It occurs on the membranes of the mitochondrion because the membranes have a large surface area on which the chemical reactions and processes that make up respiration can take place. It is the Cristae of the mitochondrion which is lined with ATP synthase enzymes which actually produce the ATP.</p>

<h3 id="anaerobic-respiration">Anaerobic Respiration</h3>

<p>Anaerobic respiration is the the process of respiration that occurs in conditions where there is an absence of oxygen. Because of the absence of oxygen only glycolysis can take place. Both the link reaction and the Krebs cycle can not be carried out this is because the reduced NAD and FAD cannot be oxidised again - this means that they cannot pick up more hydrogen. Because of this the amount of ATP produced from one molecule of glucose falls all the way from thirty-eight to just two.</p>

<p>The anaerobic respiration which leads to the production of ethanol occurs in some microorganisms and also some higher plants such as water logged root cells. The anaerobic respiration which leads to the production of lactic acid occurs primarily in muscle tissue and is the result of heavy excersise.</p>

<p>The first of these anaerobic conditions is useful, it takes place in yeast to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is a fermentation. After glycolysis the pyruvate produced is decarboxylated (producing carbon dioxide) into ethanal. NAD still accepts the hydrogen released during glycolysis it is then transferred to the ethanal which causes it to be reduced into ethanol - also known as alcohol.</p>

<p>The second aerobic condition produces lactic acid in muscle tissue. The second condition occurs when not enough oxygen can reach muscle cells, this prevents them from producing the ATP they need by aerobic respiration so they can only use the ATP produced by glycolysis. The reduced NAD from glycolysis in this situation gives up its hydrogen atom to the pyruvate which causes it to reduced into lactate - which is lactic acid. It is this lactic acid which causes muscle cramps. At the point where aerobic respiration can start again the lactic acid will be broken down by the liver and converted into glycogen as an energy store for future use.</p>

<h3 id="budget-for-energy">Budget for Energy</h3>

<p>In order to budget for the amount of energy you need it is important to know exactly how many ATP molecules are produced from the breakdown of only one molecule of glucose.</p>

<p>In glycolysis a net total of two ATP molecules is produced. This is because two out of the maximum four produced are reused for the initial activation of the glucose molecule. Glycolysis also produces two reduced NAD molecules which have the potential to produce six more molecules of ATP through aerobic respiration.</p>

<p>The link reaction produces six molecules of ATP</p>

<p>Krebs cycle produces twenty-four molecules of ATP of which two are made from substrate level phosphorylation.</p>

<p>Therefore the total amount of ATP produced from just one molecule of glucose is thirty-eight.</p>

<h3 id="respiratory-substrates">Respiratory Substrates</h3>

<p>Sometimes a different respiratory substrate than glucose is used. Both proteins and fats can also be used as alternative respiratory substrates.</p>

<p>Fats are used as an energy store in many organisms and can also be used as a respiratory substrate when levels of carbohydrates of which glucose is an example fall too low. In order to be used the lipid has to be split into its individual components; glycerol and three fatty acids. This is done by hydrolysis after which the glycerol is converted into a three carbon sugar which allows it to enter the Krebs cycle through triose phosphate. The remaining fatty acid chains are long and can be broken down into a number of two carbon fragments which enter the respiration pathway as acetyl CoA. Because the fatty acid chains can vary in length the number of ATP molecules that can be produced also varies.</p>

<p>Because it is possible to produce such a large number of ATP molecules from a lipid one gram of fat certainly releases more that two times the energy of one gram of carbohydrate.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use proteins as a respiratory substrate but only in extreme circumstances. An example of such an extreme circumstance is starvation. As a result of starvation tissue protein is used to supply energy as the energy provided in the diet is too little to be useful. In digestion the protein component of food is diverted to be used as an alternative respiratory substrate. The protein is first converted into the amino acids that make it up through the process of hydrolysation. It then travels to the liver where it is deaminated, that is the amine groups of the amino acids are removed. The removed amine groups are converted into urea and excreted and the residue is converted into either acetyl CoA, pyruvate of another of the Krebs cycle intermediaries so that it can enter the cycle. Using protein as a respiratory substrate is generally a last resort when both carbohydrate and fat resources have run out.</p>

<h3 id="pigments-in-photosynthesis">Pigments in photosynthesis</h3>

<p>White light is a mixture of different wavelengths and in photosynthesis these different wavelengths of light are trapped by a number of different pigments. There are two main types of pigments in angiosperms (flowering plants). They are chlorophylls and carotenoids - the chlorophylls absorb light which is primarily in the in the red end of the spectrum whilst carotenoids absorb wavelengths which are primarily in the blue end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>The carotenoid group can be split into a further two pigments, carotenes and Xanthophylls. These act as accessory pigments as opposed to primary pigments such as chlorophyll a.</p>

<h3 id="spectra">Spectra</h3>

<p>The important photosynthesis spectra are the absorption spectrum and the action spectrum. Both graphs are usually drawn together for easy comparison.</p>

<p>It can be shown that the different photosynthetic pigments absorb different wavelengths by preparing various pigment solutions and shining a light on them. The absorption spectrum is a graph that indicates how much light a given pigment absorbs in this situation. For example the graph shows that chlorophyll absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum - this can be seen on the graph by the peak at the end furthest from the y-axis. Similarly plotting the absorption spectrum for the other pigments produces a number of graphs with peaks at different points along the spectrum. Though this is useful for determining what wavelengths are being absorbed and by which pigments the data can not be used to determine if a particular light wavelength is actually used in the process of photosynthesis. A more useful graph for this purpose is the action spectrum. The action spectrum graph shows the rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light. More specifically it could be said that it shows the amount of carbohydrate that is produced by the plant when it is exposed to a given wavelength of light. Since carbohydrates are an eventual product of photosynthesis it can be used to determine which wavelengths of light are in fact used in photosynthesis.</p>

<p>The two graphs are easily compared as they are usually drawn together, if you were to compare the two it would show a correlation between the absorption and action spectra which gives the conclusion that the pigments are responsible for absorbing the wavelengths of light used in photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Note: It&rsquo;s probably better to say that the pigments absorb light &lsquo;energy&rsquo; that absorb light. They actually absorb photons which are packets of light.</p>

<h3 id="use-the-light-luke">Use the light Luke</h3>

<p>The photons of light from the light source (more often than not - the sun) are said to be &lsquo;harvested&rsquo;. This harvesting is performed by photosystems of which there are two - photosystem one and photosystem two. These are sometimes referred to as PS700 and PS680 respectively. The numbers refer to the peak absorption wavelength of each photosystem. Both photosystems are formed around a molecule of chlorophyll a which is the reaction centre of the photosystem, surrounding the chlorophyll in a &lsquo;funnel&rsquo; are the accessory pigments clustered together in groups of many hundred molecules in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. These groups are referred to as antenna complexes. Associated with each pigment is a protein which aids in the &lsquo;funnelling&rsquo; of the photons in the chloroplast. In this way the pigments pass the absorbed energy from one molecule to the next through the antenna complex until it reaches the reaction centre - a molecule of chlorophyll a.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1---light-dependant">Phase 1 - Light Dependant</h3>

<p>The light independent phase of photosynthesis involves several sub-processes. Photolysis - which is the splitting of water molecules using energy from photons (light) to produce hydrogen ions and electrons. The reduction of NADP into reduced NADP (NADPH) and finally the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate as in respiration. Since plants make use of light energy in this process the type of phosphorylation is photophosphorylation.</p>

<p>The process starts when photons of light hit a photosystem they pass down to the primary pigment, chlorophyll a. The energy from the photon excites electrons in the molecule of chlorophyll causing them to gain energy and move to a higher energy level. This creates a movement of electrons which can be described as the Z-scheme because of the way the electrons change energy levels can be drawn as a sideways Z. The ATP produced by this process is made in one of two ways much like there is aerobic and anaerobic respiration in photosynthesis there is cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation. It is non-cyclic photophosphorylation which usually occurs.</p>

<p>Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves both photosystem one and photosystem two. Photosystem two absorbs the photons first, the photons pass down the antenna complex to the reaction centre. This excites two electrons form chlorophyll a into a high energy state. This allows them to be picked up by electron acceptors, these electrons then get passed along a chain to electron carriers to photosystem one. On the way to photosystem one they also pass through a proton pump passing some of their energy to the pump as well as losing energy to each electron acceptor. The energy lost by the electrons along this chain is used to synthesise ATP from ADP. Photosystem one also absorbs some photons of light - again causing the excitement of two electrons into a higher energy state and allowing them to be accepted by another electron acceptor. Because photosystem two lost electrons at the start of the process the molecule of chlorophyll a in its reaction centre is now unstable, in order to re-stabilise the molecule electrons from photolysis (the splitting of water) are used. Photolysis causes water to be split into hydrogen, oxygen and electrons.</p>

<p>The electron acceptor which received electrons from photosystem one releases some of its electrons to the Hydrogen ions which are found outside the thylakoid membrane. This allows them to join with NADP to form reduced NADP. These electrons never return to a molecule of chlorophyll so the system is non-cyclic.</p>

<p>Cyclic phosphorylation on the other hand only makes used of photosystem one. As in non-cyclic photophosphorylation the light energy is absorbed by the photosystem and passed to the chlorophyll a at the reaction centre. The second electron acceptor again accepts the high energy electrons created as a result of this, the electrons which are not used to produced reduced NADP by passing them to Hydrogen ions outside the thylakoid membrane are returned to photosystem one by passing along a chain of electron acceptors. The energy generated as a result of this &lsquo;passing around&rsquo; of electrons is used to synthesise ATP.</p>

<p>Note though that cyclic photophosphorylation does not produced reduced NADP.</p>

<p>All the reactions of the light dependant phase of photosynthesis occur within the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. As the electrons are moving from one photosystem to another they pass though a proton pump which pumps protons from within the stroma across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. Like in respiration this creates an electrochemical gradient because of the build up of hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space. This electrochemical gradient forces hydrogen ions to diffuse back across the membrane through protein channels which provides energy to the ATP synthase to produce ATP from ADP and phosphate. The ATP as well as the NADP that is produced in this phase is used later on in the light dependant phase also.</p>

<h3 id="phase-2---light-independent">Phase 2 - Light Independent</h3>

<p>The light independent phase of photosynthesis makes used of the products from the light dependant phase - ATP and NADP. It occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and involves a series of enzyme catalysed reactions which use ATP as a source of energy and NADP to reduce carbon dioxide in order to synthesise hexose sugar.</p>

<p>The light independent stage of photosynthesis is often referred to as the calvin cycle and was discovered by a scientist called Calvin and his associates Benson and Bassham using radioactive carbon 14 and the alga Chlorella. The cycle starts with a five carbon molecule called RuBP which acts as an acceptor molecule combining with carbon dioxide to form an unstable six carbon compound in a reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCo. Because this six carbon compound is unstable it splits immediately into two molecules of GP. This molecule of GP is the phosphorylated by ATP and reduced by NADP into triose phosphate (TP). Some of the TP can be removed from the cycle and built into glucose phosphate and starch by condensation. However in order for the cycle to continue some of the TP must be reused. This is done by regenerating RuBP from the TP through a series of ATP powered reactions. The NADP is also remade and returns to the light dependant phase so that it can be reduced, and the reused again.</p>

<h3 id="synthesis">Synthesis</h3>

<p>The TP that is removed from the light independent phase of photosynthesis (the calvin cycle) is metabolised into a number of products such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids with which the plant can make all the chemicals it needs to live. However some inorganic ions which are nutrients needed by the plant can be a limiting factor in metabolism should they become in short supply.</p>

<p>Macronutrients such as magnesium, calcium and nitrogen are also required are needed in small amounts. Micronutrients such as copper and manganese are needed in much smaller amounts.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is taken into the plant by the roots in the form of nitrates. These nitrates are transported in the xylem and as amino acids in the phloem. Nitrogen is used for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. If a plant has a nitrogen deficiency it shows symptoms such as reduced growth and chlorosis. Chlorosis is the yellowing of the leaves caused by a drop in chlorophyll production. (Chlorosis appears first in old leaves). Magnesium forms part of the chlorophyll molecule and is absorbed as magnesium ions. All of the plants tissues require magnesium because it also actives ATPase - it is transported as ions in the xylem. Magnesium deficiency can also lead to chlorosis which occurs between the veins of old leaves because existing magnesium is diverted towards newly formed leaves where it can be best put to use.</p>

<h3 id="classification">Classification</h3>

<p>The term &lsquo;microorganism&rsquo; covers a wide range of groups including fungi,
Protoctists, Viruses and of course bacteria.</p>

<p>Bacteria can be classified in one of two ways either by their shape or by their
reaction to the Gram staining process. Bacteria can be one of three shapes -
spherical, rod shaped or spiral shaped. More scientifically they can either be
Bacillus (rod shaped), Cocci (spherical) or Spirillum (screw) shaped. So for
example Streptococcus is spherical because it is a Cocci.</p>

<p>The Gram staining process divides bacteria into two groups, gram positive or
gram negative. The difference is caused by the structure of the bacterium&rsquo;s cell
wall. A bacterium&rsquo;s cell wall is composed of polysaccharides and polypeptides
known as murein or peptidoglycan. The polysaccharides are crossed linked to give
the cell wall strength and shape it also prevents the cell from bursting (lysis)
as a result of osmosis. The cell wall of bacteria which are gram negative is
much more complex than that of gram positive bacteria. This is because the
peptidoglycan is &lsquo;assisted&rsquo; by liposaccharide molecules which protect the cell.
This prevents the cell wall from retaining the crystal violet dye and causes
them to be stained by the counter-stain so that they appear red/pink when they
are viewed under a microscope. Gram positive bacteria lack the liposaccharide
and so become stained by the crystal violet. This makes them purple under the
microscope!</p>

<p>Gram-negative bacteria are not affected by the enzyme lysozyme which is
antibacterial and is a component of our tears. Similarly they are also resistant
to penicillin, unlike gram-positive bacteria which are far more susceptible to
antibiotics (and lysozyme).</p>

<h3 id="growing">Growing</h3>

<p>Micro-organisms are well known for their ability to reproduce quickly. In optimum
conditions bacteria can divide in two every twenty minutes. They can also be
grown in the Lab on a variety of mediums given the right conditions.</p>

<p>Different micro-organisms require different conditions to grow optimally but can
grow over a range of variables. In order to grow the conditions required
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a suitable pH, bacteria prefer a ph or 7.4 which is slightly alkaline whilst
other micro-organisms like fungi prefer slightly acidic conditions.</li>
  <li>a suitable temperature, growth is normally regulated by a number of enzymes
which can be denatured by high temperatures or inhibited by cold temperatures.
The majority of bacteria grow in the temperature range of 25-45 degrees
centigrade whilst pathogens (disease causing micro-organisms) have an optimum of
37 degrees centigrade which just so happens to also be our body temperature!</li>
  <li>Nutrients - Nitrogen, carbon (as glucose usually), vitamins and mineral salts.
In a Lab setting the nutrients are often provided by the media in/on which the
bacteria are grown such as agar.</li>
  <li>Oxygen - Most micro-organisms are &lsquo;obligate aerobes&rsquo; and require oxygen for
metabolism whilst others may grow better with oxygen but do not require it
(these are &lsquo;facultative anaerobes&rsquo;). Some can not grow in Oxygen at all such as
<em>Clostridium</em> bacteria which is an &lsquo;obligate anaerobe&rsquo;. <em>Clostridium</em> in fact
cause the condition moist gangrene by destroying body tissue as a result of
producing toxins in a wound.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the micro-organisms have been growing for some time the size of the
microorganism population can be measured. This can be done either through a
indirect method such as the &lsquo;cloudiness&rsquo; of a culture (in other words its
turbidity) or through a direct method such as a Total count or a Viable count.
Total counts include both living and dead bacterium whilst viable counts only
count the number of living &lsquo;viable&rsquo; cells.</p>

<p>It is of course very difficult to count a large population of microorganisms so
the culture is diluted and the result of counting the small sample of cells is
multiplied to find the total population size. This gives a population density
measured in organisms per centimetre cubed. The dilution is called a serial
dilution - a serial dilution dilutes a culture by a factor of 10 each time.</p>

<p>Growth can be measured in many ways. One method is to make rough estimates by
measuring the diameter of the colony from a central point. Then there is serial
dilution (mentioned above), when a serial dilution is performed the assumption
is made that the separate colonies of bacteria originated from a single cell
through asexual reproduction. A more accurate method however is the
hemocytometer which uses a specialised microscope slide to give total cell
counts.</p>

<h3 id="technique">Technique</h3>

<p>Aseptic techniques are techniques used to keep apparatus and other equipment
sterile and free from microorganisms. This prevents both the bacterial cultures
themselves and the environment from becoming contaminated.</p>

<p>To avoid contaminating pure cultures with other bacteria which may be found free
in the environment all apparatus and the growing media should be sterilised
before use and the cultures should be handled carefully making use of tools like
sterile loops to prevent any later contamination.</p>

<p>To avoid contaminating the environment with experimental bacteria the
contamination of people including yourself and the immediate environment i.e. the
rest of the Lab must be prevented through correct handling of cultures. Also
work surfaces should be sterilised before and after use with disinfectant. The
most commonly used method for sterilising equipment is an autoclave. This is a
[sealed] container into which equipment is placed before being heated to 121
degrees centigrade for 15 minutes whilst under steam pressure. This method
ensures that even bacteria such as Clostridium (a gram positive bacteria) and
other resistant endospores which are resistant to boiling are destroyed. Other
materials can also be placed in the autoclave before disposal such as petri
dishes.</p>

<p>Commercially however it is more likely that radiation will be used for the
sterilisation process.</p>

<p>Note: Endospores are internal resting cells which protect nuclear material
through unfavourable conditions such as high temperature. When better conditions
occur the endospore can form back into a bacterial cell.</p>

<h3 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h3>

<p>Industrial fermentation is the process used to culture bacteria and fungi on a
large scale, such as in the production of antibiotics like penicillin. There are
several advantages for making use of microbes in the fermentation process.
Mainly it is because the microbes grow quickly and lower temperatures can be
used because enzymes do not have to be supplied which brings down cost.</p>

<p>A batch culture fermentation starts with a pure culture of the microorganism so
that a pure product is harvested at the end. A batch culture fermenter is
inoculated with the culture and the fermenter provides the suitable conditions
for growth without competition so that the process can operate at maximum
efficiency. As part of providing these ideal conditions forced aeration may also
be used. Forced aeration has the added benefit of mixing the mixture improving
the organisms contact with nutrients though this can also be done with a
dedicated mixer.</p>

<p>Numerous conditions such as temperature and pH are also monitored be
sophisticated monitors so that conditions can be controlled. For example air
inlets may have spargers which allow for improved aeration. The temperature is
also controlled by a water jacket which removes excess heat produced during the
entire process.</p>

<p>A good example of industrial fermentation is penicillin production. Penicillin
is a secondary metabolite produced by the fungus Penicillium notatum. The
Penicillium grows in the optimal conditions provided by the batch culture
fermenter and after around 30 hours penicillin is produced (it is not produced
immediately because it is a secondary metabolite) and the concentration of
penicillin in the medium increases. Approximately a week later the culture fluid
is extracted and then purified to give pure penicillin. The fermenter then has
to be re-sterilised so that it can be used again - hence it is called batch
fermentation.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are often secondary metabolites. They are produced when the organism
such as Penicillium&rsquo;s life cycle reaches the point where conditions begin to
change away from the optimum.</p>

<p>Continuous cultivation is the better method for collecting products which are
primary metabolites. This is because continuous cultivation allows for
production to continue for a longer period of time. This is the products.
Insulin is one product which is produced this way.</p>

<h3 id="the-carbon-cycle">The Carbon Cycle</h3>

<p>The carbon cycle is the flow of carbon through living organisms and the environment.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is added to the air by the respiration of animals, micro-organisms and plants and naturally the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.</p>

<p>For plants however the process of photosynthesis uses up a large amount (almost all) of the carbon dioxide that is released by the plant into the atmosphere. Plants use carbon for the production of carbohydrates, fats and proteins which contributes to plant growth and therefore animal growth as we move up the food chain.</p>

<p>When plants and animals die their dead &lsquo;bodies&rsquo; are acted on by saprobionts. Saprobionts are micro-organisms which obtain their food from the decaying remains of other organisms. These are found in the soil and release carbon dioxide as a gas back into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>For a long time the level of carbon dioxide globally in the atmosphere has risen. This is mainly because of human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation which removes a large number of photosynthesising species so less carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="the-nitrogen-cycle">The Nitrogen Cycle</h3>

<p>Like the carbon cycle the nitrogen cycle is the flow of nitrogen (both organic and inorganic) through organisms and their environment. Within the cycle there is an interchange between nitrogenous compounds which are solid an gaseous atmospheric nitrogen.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is used within living organisms to make amino acids which in turn are built up into proteins. Nitrogen is also used to produce nucleic acids; DNA and RNA.</p>

<p>Since neither plants nor animals can make use of gaseous nitrogen they must get their nitrogen source from a different compound. Plants get their nitrogen by taking in nitrates in solution through their roots. The organic nitrogen which is then produced by plants is transferred to other organisms in the food chain when the plants are are eaten by animals.</p>

<p>As with carbon when plants and animals die the nitrogen remains &lsquo;locked&rsquo; in their bodies and so must be decomposed along with excrement in order to release the nitrogen back into the soil.</p>

<p>The first process in the nitrogen cycle is Putrefaction. Putrefaction is where bacteria and fungi (which are decomposers) break down dead plants, animals and their excretory products into ammonium ions (which is why the process is sometimes also referred to as ammonification. Following this the ammonia is converted into nitrates (though nitrites) in the process of nitrification. Examples of the involved bacteria include Nitrosomonas which converts ammonium to nitrite and Nitrobacter which converts nitrite to nitrate. Both of these conversions require aerobic conditions.</p>

<p>The atmospheric nitrogen can also be converted straight into nitrogen compounds through a number of Nitrogen fixation methods. One is Lightning but there is also free living bacteria like Azotobacter which account for the majority of nitrogen fixation. Another bacteria is the symbiotic Rhizobium which is found in legumes (beans, peas and clover) which provide nitrogen to the plant as well as releasing some back into the soil.</p>

<p>Nitrogen can also be released back into the atmosphere through denitrification which involves more bacteria this time in anaerobic conditions like water logged soil. Pseudomonas is one such bacteria that can reduce nitrates and ammonium (ions) back into nitrogen.</p>

<p>We can however improve nitrogen circulation through our farming practices. Planing clover fields encourages nitrogen fixation while ploughing fields aerates the soil to create aerobic conditions. Similarly draining land that is water logged reduces anaerobic conditions too. Farmers can also use the large amount of animal waste from the rearing of livestock as manure.</p>

<p>There are other ways that we can improve nitrogen too. We can fix atmospheric nitrogen ourselves using the Haber process to convert it into fertiliser. More microorganisms can also be used for making compost and finally sewage disposal increases the supply of organic nitrogen.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-population-growth">Controlling Population Growth</h3>

<p>At any time, for any population the size of the population is found from the birth rate and death rate (though also organisms can immigrate into the population or emigrate out).</p>

<p>When a species encounters an area which it can colonise it grows following the S shaped curve which is typical for any new species. The S shape is caused by three components of the population growth. The first is the lag phase - when a species first starts to colonise an area there are few individuals so growth is slow and the organisms must adapt and prepare to grow for example by synthesising enzymes and other metabolic activity. Following the lag phase is the exponential phase. The exponential phase occurs as the populations number increases and as long as their is no factor which might limit population growth more and more of the population starts to reproduce this causes the population to grown exponentially like an e^x graph - though this can not be continued forever. Eventually the population has to stop growing, when it does it enters the stationary phase. During this phase the number of births is equal to the number of deaths and the population has reached its largest possible size. The largest size population can reach in an environment is known as the carrying capacity of that environment. After the stationary phase is the death phase, this is when the death rate is greater than the birth rate - it usually occurs when all the food has been used up.</p>

<p>The environment can also &lsquo;resist&rsquo; population growth. This resistance includes a number of factors which affect population size such as disease, the weather or the build up of toxic waste. All of these factors slow down population growth.</p>

<p>Some factors may also cause the population to &lsquo;crash&rsquo; such as density independent factors which affect all the organisms in an environment regardless of the population size. These effects are usually caused by a sudden change in an abiotic factor like the breakout of a wildfire. Other factors are those which are density dependant and whose effect increases along with the size of the population. One such example of this is the loss of a food supply. The carrying capacity of the environment as mentioned above is caused by density dependant factors.</p>

<p>Naturally population sizes vary rather than remain constant. Whilst these variations are not often large and do not occur at random intervals then the population size of a species remains close to an equilibrium position - this is the carrying capacity of the environment and if the populations numbers increase above this value then a density dependant factor acts to limit the population growth either by increasing the death rate or reducing breeding rate. When the population falls back below the equilibrium position the density dependant factor no longer affects the growth rate allowing the number to increase once again. Population variations usually occur in line with another pattern such as the season cycle (Spring - Summer - Autumn - Winter) or amount of rainfall. Therefore it is said that population variation is a process regulated by negative feedback.</p>

<p>Negative feedback is where a monitored variable changes causing a response to be triggered and the result of the response counteracts the action which first affected the monitored variable.</p>

<h3 id="competition">Competition</h3>

<p>In an environment plants and animals often have to struggle to survive. For plants the competition is often for space and nutrients (including water) as well as light. Animals also compete for space along with food and shelter. Often animals are also in competition for mates. </p>

<p>There are two different types of competition. Interspecific competition and intraspecific competition. The later is competition between individuals which are members of the same species. Such competition is dependant on density as when the population increases more members of the population do not survive. This is important because most organisms produce far more offspring than their habitat can support. If an organism is better adapted then it is more likely to win the competition and so survive.</p>

<p>Interspecific competition on the other hand occurs between members of a different species. Collectively each species occupies a given niche, this is the role that it carries out in the environment as well as the space it takes up. Two species can not occupy the same niche, one has to win.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-pests">Fighting Pests</h3>

<p>A pest is any organisms which competes with or adversely affects a population of organisms that are important economically. These pests are usually fought with pesticides, these are chemicals which are used to control organisms which spread disease such as mosquitos or those which damage farmers crops.</p>

<p>When pests attack crops and animals the result is a reduction in yield and a devastating economic loss to the farmer whose crops or animals were attacked. These pests are constantly competing with crop organisms for resources and can cause disease in &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; organisms which usually live on the crop. They often make infection through pathogens more likely and can spoil food which is in transit or whilst the food is in storage. </p>

<p>If a pest is causing a large amount of because it is present in very large numbers then it is worth the farmers while to spend money on controlling the pest.</p>

<p>When controlling pests either of chemical or biological control can be used. Chemical control is the use of pesticides or insecticides which are designed to kill insects (or less commonly herbicides and fungicides) , this method has both its advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p>The advantages of chemical control are that it is very effective - the pests population is controlled very quickly and at a comparatively low cost. It can also be applied on a small scale such as just one of the farmers fields. The chemicals can be sprayed onto the crop or applied as smokes in enclosed areas, even powders. The chemicals can also be applied to animals by being added to animal feed or sprayed directly onto the animal itself. None of these application methods require a high level of skill or understanding, another advantage.</p>

<p>There are a number of disadvantages as well. A big problem when using pesticides is that the pest you are attempting to control can become resistant to the pesticide. This is where the organism becomes able to survive a dose of the chemical which would under normal conditions be lethal. Over exposure the these chemicals can also be hazardous to humans as well. Generally the chemicals which are used as pesticides are not specific enough and therefore can also kill off &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; insects such as bees. They can also kill fish, birds and mammals by contamination of the food chain.</p>

<p>Likewise the use of biological controls where the interspecific competition between a predator and it&rsquo;s prey is used to control the pest population also has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Firstly biological control can repair some of the damage done by chemical control methods such as allowing a resurgence of &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; species. They are also usually highly specific to one pest (with the notable exception of the cane toad). In order to work correctly biological control methods must target one pest and not do any other damage to the ecosystem. Unlike chemical control biological control can also provide a long term pest control solution provided that a population equilibrium becomes established. This makes them suited to a wide range of environments including greenhouses (glasshouses). However unlike chemical control biological methods have high initial research cost so in the short term is an expensive solution though it becomes cheaper as time passes.</p>

<p>The cost of biological control is also a disadvantage because of the frequent input needed to attain a balance and the high level of skill and knowledge required - such as knowing the detailed knowledge of the pests life cycle. This is due to the potential to release an organism (like the cane toad) which can itself become a pest after it exhausts its food supply or causes damage to the ecosystem. Because of this there are only a few success stories and we do not know the control agent for a large number of our existing pest problems.</p>

<p>Biological controls are also currently of little use to individuals except for in greenhouse/glasshouse scenarios because biological control introduction needs to be carried out on a large scale.</p>

<p>Biological controls work because the abundance of prey is a factor limiting the number of its predators, in a given food chain the predator-prey relationship causes the population of both predator and prey to vary. We have been making use of this relationship to control pests. A beneficial organism is released as a predator to the undesirable pest. The aim of biological control is to reduce the pest population to a sensible level at which they no longer cause any economic damage. Sometime insect parasites are used and sometimes microorganisms are used. Pests have always been regulated by their natural predators (they can have several) however through farming we have upset the system e.g. by creating large fields and removing hedges which reduced or in some cases removes the natural habitat for predators.</p>

<p>Due to both methods having a number of advantages and disadvantages it is often considered that the best solution is to use a combination of biological and chemical control even though there have been some improvement in chemical pesticides like pyrethroids and organophosphates. These combined methods include producing pest resistant crops, changing cultivation techniques and the use of highly targeted chemicals. Such a solution is often referred to as an integrated pest control solution.</p>

<h3 id="homeostasis">Homeostasis</h3>

<p>Homeostasis is by definition the maintaining of a consistent environment within a (living) organism. For example blood sugar concentration, kidney function and temperature are all maintained. </p>

<p>A self regulating system works on the principal of negative feedback. For any variable that needs to be controlled there is a set point which is the desired value for the variable and the one at which the system operates. This variable is monitored by a sensor which triggers when the variable deviates from the desired value. When a receptor detects a change from the normal it despatches instructions to a co-ordinator. This co-ordinator then in turn communicates with a number of effectors which carry out processes to correct the variable. Once the corrections have been effected and the variables value is at the desired value then the sensor is informed - this causes the detector to &lsquo;reset&rsquo; and the process can begin again. This is what happened in most biological control systems.</p>

<h3 id="the-kidney">The Kidney</h3>

<p>The kidney performs two important functions. The first is the removal of nitrogenous waste from the body. There are three forms of nitrogenous waste. Urea which comes from amino acids, Uric acid which is from Nucleic acids and Creatinine from Creatine phosphate which is an energy store in muscles.</p>

<p>In humans it is urea that is produced. This is because the ammonia which is first produced is highly toxic so it is converted to urea which is less toxic and also soluble in water so we can remove it in our urine. If we have too much protein in our diet the excess has to be broken down as we cannot store them. This happens in the liver where the amino acids which make up proteins are deaminated - removing their amine group. This forms ammonia which is quickly converted to urea so it can be removed.</p>

<p>The urea is produced by reacting deaminated amino acids with oxygen to produce ammonia which is added to carbon dioxide to crate urea. The other product of this process is keto acid which is converted into pyruvic acid (pyruvate) for use in respiration or is converted into fat for storage.</p>

<p>Unlike us birds produce thick urine made up of uric acid which is more complex than urea and therefore takes more energy to produce - it is also less toxic. Birds produce &lsquo;solid&rsquo; urine because they carry very little water at it is heavy.</p>

<p>We have two kidneys which filter waste products from the blood. Both kidneys are made up of approximately one million seminiferous tubules which called nephrons. Each nephron contains a Bowman&rsquo;s capsule within which is a number of capillaries known collectively as the glomerulus. Blood is supplied to the nephron through the afferent arteriole, from the glomerulus the blood is taken by the efferent arteriole to two other separate capillary systems.</p>

<p>These capillary networks are the one which runs along beside the loop of Henle called the vasa recta and the capillary network serving the the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.</p>

<h3 id="ultrafiltration">Ultrafiltration</h3>

<p>Ultrafiltration is the process that occurs in the kidneys to remove small soluble molecules from blood plasma. It occurs under high pressure, hence the name ultrafiltration. Through ultrafiltration water, glucose, urea and various salts pass from the capillaries in the glomerulus to the Bowman&rsquo;s capsule. This fluid is known as glomerular filtrate or primary urine. From the Bowman&rsquo;s capsule the fluid passes through the proximal convoluted tubule and the loop on Henle, through the distal convoluted tubule into the collecting duct. By the time the fluid reaches the collecting duct it is no longer glomerular filtrate, it is urine. </p>

<p>The blood which enters the glomerulus is separated from the Bowman&rsquo;s capsule by a basement membrane through which only small molecules can pass - leaving large plasma proteins in the blood plasma. Proteins do however sometimes appear in urine - this is a symptom of high blood pressure as the pressure can force the large plasma proteins through the basement membrane. Damage to the basement membrane can also allow red blood cells into urine though it is more likely that the blood entered the urine from somewhere else.</p>

<p>The glomerulus is &lsquo;designed&rsquo; specifically for ultrafiltration to take place. With the basement membrane acting as a &lsquo;sieve&rsquo; between the capillaries and the nephron and two cell layers. The first cell layer is the actual wall of the capillary within which there are a number of small gaps then there is the basement membrane which is sandwiched between the first layer and another layer which makes up the wall of the Bowman&rsquo;s capsule - this layer also has special epithelial cells known as podocytes.</p>

<p>The pressure that allows ultrafiltration to happen is primarily supplied by the hydrostatic pressure of the blood in the capillaries of the glomerulus. This pressure is increased due to the small diameter of the efferent arteriole and also due to the water potential of the blood due to the colloidal plasma proteins. This means that the pressure within the glomerulus can be varied by varying the diameter of either of the efferent or afferent arterioles.</p>

<h3 id="reabsorption">Reabsorption</h3>

<p>Of all the materials which were originally removed from the blood through ultrafiltration only all of the glucose is reabsorbed most of the salts and water are also reabsorbed into the blood. What is left over is urine which passes to the bladder. </p>

<p>This process occurs as the glomerular filtrate flows through the nephron. The glucose and water are reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule though a small amount of water is also reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule along with some salts. Any remaining water is absorbed by the collecting duct in a process with the loop of Henle. Glucose and salts are reabsorbed by active transport whilst the water is passively absorbed by osmosis after the salt is removed.</p>

<p>The purpose of the loop of Henle is to collectively concentrate salts in the medulla of the kidney, specifically within the tissue fluid. This high concentration of salt then causes an osmotic flow of water which passes from the collecting ducts. This acts to concentrate the urine and make it hypertonic in comparison with the blood. The loop of Henle works on a principle known as the hair-pin counter-current multiplier. As the fluid flows through the ascending limb of the loop sodium and chlorine ions are pumped from the limb to the surrounding medulla thereby creating a low water potential at the apex of the loop. Because the ascending limp is impermeable to water relative to the descending limb water leaves the glomerular filtrate from the descending limb at which point it is taken away by blood in the vasa recta. This causes the fluid in the descending limb to become more and more concentrated and the fluid flowing through the ascending limb to become more and more dilute. Altogether the large number of loops create a region of low water potential in the medulla so that as the collecting ducts carrying urine pass through the medulla water passes out through osmosis allowing the counter current mechanism to act as a fine control for osmoregulation.</p>

<p>In the proximal convoluted tubule the cells are adapted for absorption by having microvilli and a large number of mitochondria. The large number of mitochondria are required to provide ATP (from respiration which takes place within the mitochondrion) for active transport whilst the microvilli create a large surface area over which absorption can take place.</p>

<h3 id="osmoregulation">Osmoregulation</h3>

<p>Osmoregulation is the homeostatic control of body water. Like most of the processes involved in homeostasis osmoregulation relies an a system of negative feedback. There are several components to the system, the first is the receptors responsible for detecting the change in water level - these are located in the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Second is the posterior lobe of the pituitary which acts as the co-ordinator of the system and thirdly the collecting ducts of the kidneys which are the effectors; acting to change the water level.</p>

<p>Like the walls of the distal convoluted tubule the permeability of the collecting ducts can also be controlled by hormones. This hormone control alongside the build up of hypertonic (interstitial) fluids in the medulla from the loop of Henle is the factor which controls wether or not the body releases hypertonic or hypotonic urine.</p>

<p>ADH is the hormone which controls the permeability of the collecting duct walls. It makes the walls permeable so that water is reabsorbed. The result of this is that the urine has a concentration which is similar to that of other body fluids, i.e. it is hypertonic to them. Water reabsorption is controlled by a feedback system, negative feedback acts to restore the normal osmotic concentration should the blood become more diluted or similarly if it becomes more concentrated.</p>

<p>There are several things that may cause a drop in the water potential of blood, excessive sweating, high salt intake and reduced water consumption. The level of salt (sodium chloride) in the blood is an indication of the volume of water in the body, it it this that the hypothalamus is sensitive to. If the water level in the blood is low osmotic receptors detect the drop in water potential which triggers nerve impulses which travel to the posterior pituitary gland. As a result of the nerve impulses the gland releases ADH into the blood. The ADH increases the distal convoluted tubule&rsquo;s and the collecting duct&rsquo;s permeability to water. This increase in permeability means more water is reabsorbed from these tubules into the region of high solute concentration found in the medulla from where it is reabsorbed into the blood such that the small volume of urine eventually released is concentrated.</p>

<h3 id="adaptations-for-environments">Adaptations for Environments</h3>

<p>Different animals produce different types of nitrogenous waste and so have different waste disposal mechanisms. The animals environment has a large role in the type of nitrogenous waste that is produced. For example aquatic organisms such as fish produce ammonia which is highly toxic to us and also to fish however since fish are surrounded by water the ammonia can diffuse out of the fish across the gills where it is quickly diluted to a safe level.</p>

<p>Birds and insects on the other hand excrete uric acid which is almost entirely insoluble. It is also non-toxic unlike ammonia and urea. It does however have a large energy &lsquo;cost&rsquo; associated with the process which produces it. The advantage to the bird is that little to no water is required for it to be excreted. This is important as it means that the animal can survive in dry environments and conserve water. For birds it also makes them lighter as the have to carry less heavy water around.</p>

<p>Mammals such as ourselves excrete urea in our urine. To produce urea does require energy but not as much as that which is required to produce uric acid. It is also less toxic than the ammonia which fish produce and so it can be kept in our tissues in higher concentrations albeit for only short periods of time.</p>

<p>In order for mammals to live in deserts and other arid conditions they have adapted to have the loop of Henle which has a large role in water absorption (see reabsorption in earlier in this section). The longer a mammals loop of Henle the greater the solute concentration that can build up in the medulla and also the greater amount of water that can be reabsorbed. The result is highly concentrated urine. Some mammals like the kangaroo rat have particularly long loops of Henle. </p>

<p>To survive with little or even no water some animals must depend upon metabolic water. This metabolic water is produced by the breakdown of food reserves during respiration. Alongside this desert animals live underground during the day, their burrows are cool and humid so they lose less water through evaporation.</p>

<h3 id="resistance">Resistance</h3>

<p>Resistance is the ability of an organism to survive exposure to harmful chemicals such as poisons which in normal cases would result in the death of the organism. Examples of resistance developing are found among the rat population. Warfarin is an anticoagulant which has in the past been used as a large scale in a bid to keep rats of the species Rattus norvegicus numbers down.</p>

<p>Warfarin resistance is conferred to a rat by the dominant R allele. As well as making the rats resistant to warfarin it also makes the rat need vitamin K. RR (homozygous) rats require a large amount of vitamin K which is difficult for them to obtain. Rr (heterozygous) rats only have a small vitamin K requirement giving them the advantage over the homozygous rats and homozygous non resistant rats. In the absence of warfarin however RR (homozygous resistant) rats fare worse than non resistant rats (small rr). Because the heterozygous rats have the most advantage all three possible gametes Rr, rr, RR, being produced per generation.</p>

<p>Bacteria are also becoming increasingly resistant. MRSA is a methicillin resistant strain of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria which is resistant to penicillin&rsquo;s like meticillin which are antibiotics. (meticillin is the British approved name and INN whilst methicillin is the US approved name). Resistance in bacteria arises by mutations occurring randomly in populations of bacteria which provide an advantage if the particular antibiotic is present e.g. in hospitals. Resistance can take a number of forms. The bacteria can produce enzymes which break down the antibiotic such as penicillinase which breaks down penicillin. If penicillin is present in this cases the bacteria which produce the enzyme are favoured so survive to reproduce. This selection pressure is affected by both the quantity and frequency of the penicillin usage. Bacteria have developed a wide range of resistances through repeated exposure to antibiotics with resistant genes being passed on to each subsequent generation.</p>

<p>When bacteria sexually reproduce (conjugation) resistance can be passed between the organisms on plasmids. This can only occur between individuals which are members of the same species but it does mean that a pathogen can become resistant to a given antibiotic before it is used to fight them.</p>

<p>Resistance development is especially common in agriculture because farm reared animals which are kept indoors commonly spread diseases among them as a result of the confined space. To prevent this broad spectrum antibiotics are added to animal feed to prevent disease but in fact allows resistance to develop.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-selection">Artificial Selection</h3>

<p>Artificial selection is also known as selective breeding makes use of the natural variations that occur within a population to produce the best organisms possible. Humans often choose animals with the best characteristics to breed from in order to maximise profit etc. This means that instead of the environment dictating the alleles which occur in future generations we do instead. Artificial selection mimics natural selection but happens at an accelerated rate. It can lead to very distinct breeds forming such as in dogs and many plants.</p>

<p>Although artificial selection does occur at an increased rate it can still take many years to produce organisms which have the desired characteristics. These organisms are of the same species as their relatives but are often called breeds in animals and varieties in plants.</p>

<p>Artificial selection can occur in one of two ways. The first is through inbreeding. Inbreeding occurs when the gametes of close relatives fuse. It has a number of disadvantages which mean that occasionally it becomes necessary to introduce new genes through outbreeding. The disadvantage of inbreeding is called inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression occurs because inbreeding favours homozygosity. Homozygosity means that the chance of a recessive allele expressing itself through a double recessive individual increases. Outbreeding which is also used to &lsquo;undo&rsquo; some of the damage caused by inbreeding occurs when unrelated varieties or breeds are crossed. Unlike inbreeding outbreeding favours heterozygosity. Hybrid vigour or heterosis in which organisms have improved function in a hybrid offspring is caused by outbreeding. This occurs when new chromosomes are introduced which are complementary in their effects - one example of this is modern wheat development.</p>

<h3 id="biodiversity">Â Biodiversity</h3>

<p>Humans have a large impact in biodiversity both negatively e.g. driving species to extinction and positively e.g. species conservation programs.</p>

<p>Extinction is firstly a natural process. It has taken place since from the very first organisms and continues to the present day. The issue is however that extinctions occur at a much increased rate now in comparison with the background rate which scientists believe is the normal rate at which extinction would be occurring. The background rate is said to be 1 in every 1 million species per year. It is also estimated that human activity (primarily in the tropics but also through agriculture, forestry, mining and expanding our own population i.e. urban development) has increased this by over 10000 times. Extinction is also not simply confined to terrestrial animals - marine life is also impacted especially by the removal of corral reefs on which a third of marine life depends.</p>

<p>Those organisms which are &lsquo;on the brink&rsquo; of extinction are said to be endangered species. The decline in numbers which leads to a species becoming endangered is often attributed to three main causes. These causes are over hunting or over fishing, habitat loss, competition from other species (especially those which have been introduced). Pollution, deforestation and destruction of wetlands are also attributed as causing a decline in population numbers. By altering ecosystems in this manner not only is the organism or organisms which inhabit the ecosystem affected but also other species which are dependant on those organisms too.</p>

<p>Any organism has the potential to contain useful chemicals or disease fighting genes. As a result it is important to conserve the gene pool of every species on earth as best as possible. This is done through species conservation which is the planned preservation of wildlife.</p>

<p>The animals and plants that we make use of through farming and horticulture are descendants of wild plants and animals. Unlike wild animals and plants they have more &lsquo;genetic uniformity&rsquo; and little to no rare alleles. Even when performing artificial selection some characteristics may be overlooked which could later become more important. For example if you were choosing only the biggest cattle for meat purposes you might not realise that you were also selecting for less hairy cows which might not survive well should it suddenly become cold. To reintroduce this genes wild plants and animals need to be used much like a &lsquo;gene bank&rsquo; would be. It is important to carry out species conservation at the present time rather than later because it may become too late.</p>

<p>Numerous steps have been taken to prevent the loss of genes which may be potentially useful. These steps include: Storage of seeds in seed banks, sperm banks, caring of older breeds through &lsquo;rare breed societies&rsquo;, various pieces of legislation such as CITES, reintroduction programmes, breeding programmes, public awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>Legislation like CITES can be used to prevent over-fishing, over-hunting, plant collecting and egg collecting - not just trade (in endangered species) prevention.</p>

<p>Another system that has been developed in order to promote conservation is that of ecotourism. Ecotourism is responsible travel to places which have natural environments that are in need of conservation and which the tourism improves the well being of the local [human] population.</p>

<p>The goals of ecotourism include: contributing to conservation, employing local people, giving back to the community, co-operation with local people and educating the visitors as well as the local people about the environmental issues involved.</p>

<p>The UK body for promoting nature conservation is the countryside commission. The countryside commission produces a number of publications and creates nature reserves - advising government on the activities that affect the countries wildlife and that wildlife&rsquo;s natural habitat.</p>

<h3 id="exploitation-through-farming">Exploitation through farming</h3>

<p>Farming is one of the ways in which human beings act to reduce biodiversity. This is because farming is becoming increasingly more advanced (technologically speaking) and efficient in order to keep up with the intense demands of human food consumption. A number of changes which make taken place since the end of world war two have had a large impact on the environment - primarily because mechanisation was introduced but also because fertiliser and pesticide usage also soared.</p>

<p>The impact on the environment from these changes is related to the growing size of fields to accommodate large machinery. To get the machinery into the field hedgerows had to be removed - taking away a vital habitat for many small animals such as mice and birds. Further in the large fields farmers tended to only grow one crop such as wheat or maize. This is known as a monoculture. A monoculture is the growing of a large number of crops which are of a simpler type as well as age and that are grown simultaneously. Monocultures result in reduced species diversity and in the long term lead to decreased year on year yield. The decline in yield can be attributed to one of two factors. The first of these is mineral depletion in which intensive cultivation of the crop requires an ever increasing amount of nitrate (inorganic) fertilisers. As well as more fertiliser intensive cultivation attracts pests and crop related diseases therefore increasing amounts of pesticide must also be used to kill of the pests which are usually insects.</p>

<p>Farming however is changing. In 1995 with the passing of the Environment act the UK government reversed the removal of hedgerows. Hedgerows are perhaps the most important habitat in a heavily farmed area. This is because hedges act as wildlife corridors which allow animals to move between different areas of woodland which also maintains the woodland biodiversity. Hedges also provide habitats and nesting sites for a wide range or birds and animals which live and feed on the other animals such as insects present in the hedgerow.</p>

<p>In general people have become far more aware and protective of &lsquo;their&rsquo; countryside so farmers have been encouraged to manage their farms to increase biodiversity including grants for giving up land for conservation efforts.</p>

<h3 id="deforestation">Deforestation</h3>

<p>Although around 35% of the earth surface is covered in forest that number is decreasing rapidly - in the last 30 years alone half the worlds forests have been cut down. This is deforestation. Under normal circumstances a forest can regenerate naturally or be replanted artificially to make up for felled trees however tree felling now happens so fast that woodlands are being cut down faster than they can be replaced.</p>

<p>Forests are a very important ecosystem. Because they consist primarily of large plants (trees) they help maintain the balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the earths atmosphere. Without forests controlling this balance climate change and further habitat destruction occur. Several factors &lsquo;drive&rsquo; deforestation. The primary factor is human need - these reasons include: Wood for use as fuel (as well as building materials paper and packaging), land clearance for farming and new transport infrastructure e.g. roads.</p>

<p>As a consequence of deforestation other natural habitats are destroyed. 50% of the earths species live in tropical rain forests (though 10% of the earth is covered in them) and removal of these species habitats results in &lsquo;incalculable&rsquo; losses in terms of loss of genes or medicinal properties that have not yet been investigates through extinction. Another consequence of deforestation is soil erosion. Soil erosion is the removal of the topsoil - a layer of soil which contains valuable nutrients. Soil erosion is caused by loosening of the topsoil as a result of digging and ploughing for agricultural purposes and the removal of vegetation which also impacts local climate. The key effect of vegetation removal on the local climate is reduction in rainfall which speeds up the process of desertification i.e. the formation of a desert from fertile land. Lowland flooding is also a issue caused by soil erosion (and therefore by deforestation) because the removal of vegetation on high slopes on mountains and valleys causes exposed soil to be washed into the flood plains on low ground after heavy rain. If vegetation were present on the flood plain the water would be better absorbed and would subsequently pass quickly into the atmosphere through transpiration. Instead the lack of vegetation means that the water must instead evaporate into the atmosphere - a slower process than transpiration which results in wetter soil conditions and more susceptibility to flooding.</p>

<p>Deforestation also contributes to climate change. This is because carbon dioxide traps heat in the earths atmosphere. When it isn&rsquo;t removed by trees there is a massive increase globally in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration which adds to increases in earths temperature. The rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere is linked to the rate of photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Deforestation can be reduced through good forest management. Managed forests are sustainable and managed forestry involves the replanting and regeneration of the forest. An example of a forest management technique used in Britain is coppicing. Coppicing has been used here for over a thousand years and is the cutting down of trees close to the ground before they are left for a number of years to regrow. Coppicing works here because because of our deciduous forests - most deciduous trees grow from the base if their trunks are cut down. Selective cutting is another widely used forest management technique. Selective cutting is felling only some large trees leaving the others in place to provide a habitat and allowing them to continue growing - this maintains the nutrients in the soil and prevents soil from being washed into waterways. Selective cutting is most often used on steep slopes. It has to be used in this case because tree removal leaves the soil open to erosion. After felling part of a forest it is often left before it is re-harvested, this is known as long rotation and it also increases the sustainability of the forest.</p>

<p>Good forest management also improves efficiency with several steps being taken to improve the availability of the forest as a source of timber without damaging the ecosystem. Efficiency can be increased by planting trees at an optimal distance apart from one another because it decreases intra specific competition and allows the trees to grow wide and tall producing quality timber. Efficiency can also be increased by removing a similar amount of trees on a regular cycle. Yearly for example. This maintains the ecosystem because species can exist in their habitat without disturbance even though wood is being extracted. Finally good forest management also requires the careful control of pests and diseases. Free from disease and pests more quality timber is produced by forests meaning that less trees need to be felled in the first place. Because less trees are felled less land is needed so this control allows us to make the best use of the land available.</p>

<p>In the UK 10% of the country is covered in forest. Only 1% of this 10&amp; or 0.1% of the UK is covered in native or natural woodland. These woodlands in particular must be conserved to maintain as well as increase biodiversity. Currently there are plans and a need to plant more native woodland species to increase the available habitat for the numerous species which inhabit them.</p>

<h3 id="biofuels">Biofuels</h3>

<p>A biofuel is any fuel which has a biological origin. This includes ethanol as well as diesel which has been made from corn, sugarcane and rapeseed along with other crops, wood, wood shavings or clippings, biogas (aka methane from animal excrement) and so on.</p>

<p>Ethanol is a good example of a biofuel because it is made through fermentation in the same way that beer is produced it is though usually mixed with petrol before use - reducing its environmental friendliness. Oilseed rape or Rapeseed (Brassica napus) is a member of the mustard family and is known for its oil rich seeds and is largely the source of the worlds vegetable oil. Biodiesal is an oil substitute made from this plant which can be used on its own or mixed with other chemicals for use as fuel. Biogas which is primarily methane is often used in small scale power generators rather than directly as fuel.</p>

<p>Biofuels are said to be &lsquo;climate friendly&rsquo; as they are supposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with traditional fossil fuels which; when burnt produce carbon dioxide which traps heat in the atmosphere thereby contributing to global warming. The primary way that they work to reduce emissions are through reduction in carbon dioxide emissions but also through the growing of the crops which are used to produce the fuels in the first place which take some of the carbon dioxide n out of the air through photosynthesis. Biofuels however are not entirely biologically friendly because they require farming, processing and other treatment which can make them as polluting as their petroleum based counterparts.</p>

<p>Currently the country that produces and uses the largest amount of biofuel is brazil. The sugarcane industry is big in the country - producing 16 billion litres of ethanol per year. Most new cars in the country now run on an 85% ethanol mix. There is a problem with biodiversity in countries which depend on and produce large amounts of biofuel. Like much of the UK and other western countries farmland, to produce large amounts of biofuel fields of monocultures are used which can reduce the habitat available to native plant and animal species e.g. in some Asian countries it has been considered that rainforests be chopped down to make way for palm oil plantations. Crops such as corn or soy being used in biofuel can increase the cost to consumers buying the crop for eating thereby reducing food supply to less prosperous regions.</p>

<p>There are barriers to biofuel production however. Current engines can cope with the new fuels generally speaking - plant production is a limiting factor. This is because only a small part of the plant can be used. Plants have cellulose cell walls which have to be broken down before fermentation (in the case of ethanol production). Work is currently being done to create &lsquo;second generation&rsquo; biofuels which will make use of or process the cellulose making production more efficient and allowing a wider range of plants and plant waste to be used.</p>

<p>Because of current problems with biofuel production opposers to biofuel often cast doubt on the climate benefit of biofuels. Instead they say that priority should be given to cutting energy use rather than run financial initiatives for biofuel producers - the farmers.</p>

<h3 id="overfishing">Overfishing</h3>

<p>In recent times there has been a significant increase in the intensity of fishing. As a result commercial fishing has caused overfishing around the world. Overfishing can be loosely defined as the rate of fishing exceeding the rate at which fish breed.</p>

<p>Commercial fishing takes a number of different forms. Drift netting for example is used to catch pelagic fish which inhabit the upper parts of the water. The size of the fish caught by this method is dependant on the size of the mesh of the net that is used. In some cases the fish caught are too small to sell but are dead before they are thrown back.</p>

<p>To catch mid and bottom feeder fish a different technique is used. This is called trawling. Unlike drift nets which are suspended between floats and boats trawl nets are dragged through the water. This has the unfortunate effect of &lsquo;catching&rsquo; everything in the nets path. As with drift netting the mesh size of the trawl net is important and in most places closely regulated so as to prevent fishermen from catching younger fish which have not yet matured enough to reproduce and so maintain fish stocks.</p>

<p>Maintaining fish stocks isn&rsquo;t just important for sustaining aquatic ecosystems it is also important in maintaining the fishermen&rsquo;s livelihoods. With no fish to catch there wouldn&rsquo;t be any fishermen. To ensure that both are kept in balance i.e. there are enough fish to make a living with but also enough to replenish stocks a number of measures have been taken. These measures include restricting mesh size (as mentioned earlier) to reduce accidental catches, international agreements which place quotas on the size of catches as well as local quotas on catches based on the size of the current fish stock as estimated by scientists. exclusion zones and closed/open seasons. All of these methods require an amount of enforcement to be effective which can be costly.</p>

<p>Overfishing has effects on entire food chains if a particular species is overfished. Overfishing of organisms lower in the food chain reduces the population size of those further up. Krill (a small shrimp) are an example of this because they are positioned low in the food chain - feeding on phytoplankton. They convert the energy from these animals into a form suitable for other animals such as whales (whose diet consists primarily of krill), squid, seals, penguin and other fish. Krill are especially overfished in the Antarctic where they can be found in swarms which are miles across. From the 1980&rsquo;s onwards Russia, South Korea, Poland, Ukraine, Chile, and Japan (6 countries) have been harvesting tons of krill impacting the whale population which has already been overexploited.</p>

<p>Rather than fishing in open waters some fish have become farmed. Perhaps surprisingly fish can grow very well in warm waters discharged from factories as well as in ponds, lakes and estuaries in which they live in enclosures. These enclosures are managed and have predators removed along with their food supplies maintained at an optimum level through the addition of artificial fertilisers which aid phytoplankton growth. These phytoplankton are later eaten by the fish which are being farmed.</p>

<p>Fish farming poses a number of problems. Most of these problems arise as a result of the way the fish stock are kept. Fish are often in cramped conditions very close together in order to make the most profit from as little space. This means that disease can easily spread between the fish and into wild fish populations. For this reason large amounts of antibiotics are added to the &lsquo;farm&rsquo; to keep the fish healthy. Along with these pesticides are used (as with a conventional farm) to kill of fish parasites. Like the diseases these pesticides can spread from the farm and harm marine invertebrates. Fish excreta can also spread out into the surroundings from the warm and cause eutrophication. Eutrophication is the sudden growth of algae/cyanobacteria due to excessive richness of nutrients in the body of water.</p>

<p>On occasion the fish themselves may also escape from the farm. If this happens and the escaped fish breed with the wild stock the wild fish population can be weakened. Further in order to farm the fish (especially carnivorous fish like salmon) you have to have more fish in the first place - salmon eat 3 times their own weight in fish food. Since the fish food consists mainly of other fish this is not a good use of the environment. Today about half of the salmon sold worldwide comes from fish farms. Salmon however have a problem (both types, wild and farmed) they contain PCB&rsquo;s or polychlorinated biphenyls and high levels of dioxins. PCB&rsquo;s often come from the fish feed and are a persistent organic pollutant which has been shown to cause cancer and other illnesses in both other animals and humans. These chemicals build up in salmon because they are high in the food chain and also because they accumulate in fat. Seals are another marine animal effected by these chemicals.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-cycle">Carbon cycle</h3>

<p>Human activity also impacts the carbon cycle. In recent years (the last century) there has been a dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This increase has been largely attributed to fossil fuel combustion. In all this accounts for 70% of the carbon dioxide increase in the last 50 years with 76% of the carbon dioxide from industrial countries. Deforestation accounts for the remaining 30% increase in carbon dioxide levels. 50% of the worlds forest have been removed in under 30 years. Forests are important because they maintain the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by using it in photosynthesis, replacing it with oxygen. It is important that carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the atmosphere are balanced because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Like the other greenhouse gases: methane and CFC&rsquo;s it absorbs heat reflected from the earths surface and prevents it from escaping into space thereby raising the temperature of the earth at the surface. This is the cause of global warming.</p>

<p>Global warming leads to changes in climate including changes in patterns of rainfall and rises in the level of seas. See level rises are caused by the melting of polar icecaps which can lead to increased flooding in coastal or low lying areas. Forest fires, cyclones (and tropical cyclones aka hurricanes) as well as prolonged drought can also be caused by climate changes resulting from global warming. In terms of drought in same places around the world deserts may form due to the decreased water availability. It is possible to refer to the increased crop yields as an upside to global warming but scientists have suggested that this may increase insect pest populations as well. Crop yields will also fall elsewhere. Grain crops in north america and some asian countries would be reduced with economic consequences.</p>

<p>In a bid to fight global warming ongoing genetic engineering research is being carried out to develop drought resistant crops. Already this research has determined the gene which controls water efficiency in plants but it will require many more years of research before the ideas are developed enough that drought resistant crops become a reality.</p>

<h3 id="fertilisers">Fertilisers</h3>

<p>Fertiliser use in farming also has an impact on the environment. Developed agriculture is intensive, producing more and more crops from smaller areas of land. To achieve this fertilisers containing nitrate are used. These fertilisers have a detrimental affect on both terrestrial and aquatic organisms.</p>

<p>The effects of the fertiliser use are due to excess nitrate in the soil. The excess fertiliser is used by plants such as grasses and nettles which grow taller and faster covering smaller plants so that they do not receive enough sunlight, In the long term this reduces species diversity. The excess nitrates can also run off into water bodies nearby or slowly leach into rivers along with phosphates. This causes a build up of salts in bodies of water until an equilibrium is reached. At this point the salts are removed at the same rate as they are added. Because sewage works and fertilisers carry large amounts of these salts (nitrates and phosphates) leaching results in eutrophication of lakes and rivers. It is easy for nitrates to enter water because they are highly soluble. Their build up causes algal blooms because of the excessive nutrients in the water. If this happens the water becomes densely populated with species of algae turning the surface green, preventing any light from penetrating deep into the water. This means that the plants in deeper water cannot photosynthesise and die out. This has a knock on effect in reducing the number of animal species because they rely in these plants for food and shelter. Algae however are short lived and die very quickly. They are decomposed by saprobiotic bacteria in a process that requires lots of oxygen. This biochemical oxygen demand (sometimes written BOD) causes the water to become deoxygenated except very near to the surface. This results in fish and other animals which rely on the oxygen to die out also. More bacteria may reduce the nitrate to nitrite in the water during the final stages of eutrophication. Because both of these chemicals are toxic there is an EU wide limit of 11.3 parts per million of nitrogen in water which is suitable for humans to drink. Unfortunately this amount has been exceeded in the UK in some places.</p>

<p>There is further strict legislation aimed at stopping the high nitrite level problem. This includes forcing farmers to restrict the amount of fertiliser they use and the time when they use it so that it is only used when the crops are actively growing. Legislation also adds 10 metre clear strips by any watercourse and drainage ditches.</p>

<h3 id="flow-of-energy">Flow of Energy</h3>

<p>The energy flow through an ecosystem begins with producers. These are green plants which take the energy from the sun (through photosynthesis) and build sugars using that energy. The source of all the energy in the system is the sun, the energy is simply passed up trophic levels through the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Primary consumers are those which feed on the producers, these are Herbivores since they are animals that feed on plants. Secondary and tertiary consumers (and higher) are Carnivores, eating the animals below them in the chain. These groups are referred to as trophic levels as biological material is eaten the energy contained therein is passed on the the consumer. To get out of the system the energy must leave as heat. This happens at each trophic level where a large loss in energy occurs. The energy is primarily lost through respiration and through the excretion of various unneeded waste products e.g. Urea. Since energy is lost at each level the ultimate length of the food chain is limited. Usually the food chain is limited to around 4 levels, Producer -&gt; Primary Consumer -&gt; Secondary Consumer -&gt; Tertiary Consumer.</p>

<p>Each level involves the &lsquo;building in&rsquo; of some of the energy into the organic molecules of the organism at that level. On death these organic molecules still remain in the organism along with the energy they contain. To release this energy decomposers are detritivores which behave as saprobionts recycle the nutrients and release the energy into the environment.</p>

<p>Decomposers are microbes such as fungi which take their nutrients for faeces and dead organisms e.g. Trees. Before decomposers can work on decomposition, larger organisms like earthworms feed on detritus (they are Detritivores) to decompose it. This detritus is made up of abiotic (non-living) material like faeces, dead organisms and the fallen leaves from trees.</p>

<p>Diagrams can be used to represent this flow of energy through the ecosystem. There are several types of diagram (pyramids of biomass etc) - primarily however pyramids of energy are used. A pyramid of energy is a diagram which shows the amount of energy which is transferred between each trophic level, travelling up the pyramid. The energy transferred is given as per metre squared per unit time as such it represents the total energy requirement of the next trophic level in the chain.</p>

<p>The pyramid is formed from the size of the bars decreases at each level due to energy loss the pyramid can never be &lsquo;upside down&rsquo; because energy is only lost at each level not added. When comparing communities energy pyramids can also prove useful to compare how efficiently energy is transferred between the different communities in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The energy that is provided by producers to animals higher up in the food chain comes from the photons of light from the sun. Producers cannot absorb all of the suns energy however and a large amount is unabsorbed either because it is reflected or because it misses chlorophyll or just doesn&rsquo;t hit the plants leaves at all.</p>

<p>The energy that the producer does capture from the sun is called the gross primary productivity. This GPP refers to the rate at which the products from photosynthesis are formed. A significant amount of gross production is used up. Such as glucose in respiration. What is left over after this is referred to as net primary productivity. Primary consumers can obtain the energy that is represented by the NPP. Consumers also have a name for the rate at which their cels and tissues &lsquo;build up&rsquo; energy - it is called Secondary productivity.</p>

<h3 id="flow-consumers">Flow (Consumers)</h3>

<p>Herbivores such as sheep and other grazing animals eat a large amount of plant material i.e. producers but not all of it. For example the sheep may eat a lot of grass but will not eat the roots of the grasses. Some of this material is eaten by other herbivores but often it &lsquo;goes to waste&rsquo;. As a result consumers have a efficiency of approximately 10% - eating 10 grams of food nets them a mere gram. This coupled with the fact that some herbivores like cows are unable to digest cellulose (they lack the correct enzymes) effectively this means that only some of the net primary productivity is in fact transferred to primary consumers. However the energy from undigested cellulose is not lost since it is made available to decomposers through the faeces of the animal. In all herbivores are less efficient than carnivores. This is because carnivores lose only 20% of their energy intake through excretion. Carnivores also have a higher Secondary productivity due to their easily digestible diet which is rich in protein. This means that 2 times the amount of energy per unit mass of food is taken in by carnivores compared with herbivores.</p>

<h3 id="succession">Succession</h3>

<p>A succession is the change that occurs in a community in terms of its composition and structure over time. If a habitat has not previously supported a community before then the first succession refers to when the different species that make up the community are introduced or begin to colonise the area. An example of this would be grass seeds after a volcanic eruption. Secondary successions on the other hand are where organisms are reintroduced into an area which has previously supported a community.</p>

<p>Over time species diversity in the community gradually increases until such time as a table state is reached. This stable state is known as a climax community e.g. (in the UK) an Oak woodland.</p>

<h3 id="communities">Communities</h3>

<p>A Community is the different populations of species which can be found living in a habitat. Since Ecosystems are dynamic they don&rsquo;t remain the same indefinitely. When the environment changes it has a direct impact on the organisms which inhabit it. Likewise, if an organism changes it too impacts on the environment.</p>

<p>When a group of organisms colonise a new environment they are referred to as a pioneer community. The pioneer community (in fact any community) can consist of both animals as well as plants. These first plants and animals are pioneer species lay the groundwork for further successions, that is changes in the structure and composition of the community as time goes on. Eventually a climax community is formed. A climax community is one which has reached an equilibrium point in relation to its environment. There are no further changes in a climax community so the community is said to be stable. For this reason the community usually consists of long lived plants and animals.</p>

<p>During the development of the climax community Human activity may have a direct or indirect impact on the succession which can in some cases prevent the natural development of the climax community. e.g. Controlled burning, Farming, Soil erosion &amp; deforestation.</p>

<h3 id="genetic-code">Genetic Code</h3>

<p>A DNA molecule can be further subdivided into genes. A gene consists of a certain length of DNA on a chromosome which codes for the production of a particular polypeptide in the process of protein synthesis. These genes make up the genetic code of a cell. These are carried in DNA across generations of the same cell. This code determines what reactions can take place in the cell and therefore in the entire organism. Genes code of polypeptides which are built into proteins like enzymes. These enzymes determine the characteristics of an organism. These characteristics are the phenotype of the organism. Each polypeptide code is a &lsquo;triplet code&rsquo;. That is each polypeptide is coded for by 3 bases on a DNA strand. A DNA molecule has four different nitrogenous bases. These are: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. If only one base was used per amino acid there would only be 4 (one for each base), if two were used there would be 16 amino acids in total. However there are over 20 amino acids coded for by the triplet code. Some of the codes however are actually STOP and START codons which signal to the ribosome when to stop building a protein. A codon is a set of three bases. Each codon is always read separately and do not overlap. These codons are not just the ones used in humans, they are exactly the same in every single living organism.</p>

<h3 id="replication">Replication</h3>

<p>When a cell divides it is important that the offspring have an exact copy of the genetic material in the parent cell. This means that Chromosomes in the parent cell must make exact copies of themselves - this takes place during interphase. To carry out DNA replication the hydrogen bonds holding together the nitrogenous base &lsquo;steps&rsquo; of the DNA break. Once this has occurred to two separate parts of the DNA molecule separate further. As this separation happens the DNA unwinds. Each strand of the DNA is a template (like an engineers blueprint for making an exact copy) for its complementary strand i.e. its opposite. Free nucleotides from the cytoplasm are added to these exposed strands in a reaction that is catalysed by DNA polymerase. This forms two DNA molecules each with a fresh chain of nucleotides but also with a strand of the original DNA molecule. Because of this mixture between new and old parts of DNA this process is referred to as &lsquo;semi conservative replication&rsquo;. The semi conservative replication hypothesis was confirmed using an experiment which used E. Coli bacteria and different isotopes of the element nitrogen. The bacteria E. Coli was first cultured over many generations in a nutrient media containing the heavy isotope of nitrogen N15 within the supplied amino acids. This N15 was then incorporated into the bacteria DNA through its nucleotides. After a number of generations all the DNA contained the heavier N15 isotope. To confirm this the bacteria had their DNA extracted and ran through an ultra-centrifuge. An ultra-centrifuge rotates centrifuge tubes containing suspensions at high speed causing denser particles to separate out of the tube at a lower point. In this case the heavy N15 caused the DNA to settle at a low point in the tube. The bacteria were then transferred to another medium this one containing the isotope of nitrogen N14 which is lighter than the N15 form. The bacteria were also allowed to divide in this medium. These bacteria also had their DNA extracted after the first and second generations. The first generation of bacteria cultured on the N14 medium had mid density DNA due to the heavy N15 strand and the new lighter N14 strand. The second generation of bacteria on the other hand had low density DNA which settled at the top of the suspension after passing through the centrifuge. This was because the new DNA strands were made from the light N14 isotope. This difference in the density of each DNA molecule is the evidence for the semi conservative hypothesis.</p>

<h3 id="protein-synthesis-and-amino-acids">Protein synthesis and amino acids</h3>

<p>DNA is the fundamental start of protein synthesis; acting as a template to create a protein out of its constituent amino acids. Whilst the DNA molecule never leaves the nucleus itself one strand is used to form mRNA (messenger RNA) in transcription. It is this molecule which leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pores and enters the cytoplasm where it is used by a number of ribosomes to build proteins. This build process is translation and uses complementary (to the mRNA strand) tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules to chain together linked amino acids into a polypeptide chain. After translation has occurred this tRNA is released from its bound amino acid (which is now in the polypeptide chain) and can collect more amino acids from the cells amino acid &lsquo;pool&rsquo;. This collection of amino acids is called activation and requires ATP to provide the energy the allows the amino acid to be attached to the tRNA.</p>

<h3 id="transcription">Transcription</h3>

<p>Transcription is the first step in protein synthesis and is the process of building the mRNA strand which will eventually leave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm (the location of protein synthesis). First the enzyme helicase acts on a particular part of the DNA called the cistron. In doing so the helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases and causes the newly separated DNA to move apart. This make the bases in that section of DNA available to another enzyme - RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase binds to the exposed template strand of the DNA at the start point of the to be copied sequence. Free RNA nucleotides then align themselves with the template strand. The free RNA nucleotides align to complement the DNA strand e.g. cytosine -&gt; guanine, thymine -&gt; adenine and adenine which in RNA binds with uracil which is not present in DNA. RNA polymerase then travels down the DNA strand bonding together the RNA nucleotides into a molecule of mRNA. Just behind the travelling RNA polymerase molecule the DNA winds back up again. Once the mRNA has been synthesised it then leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm and attaches to one or more ribosomes which consist of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and protein.</p>

<h3 id="translation">Translation</h3>

<p>The ribosome which the mRNA molecule reaches is formed from two smaller sub units. A small sub unit which has two sites for attachment of tRNA (so only two molecules of tRNA can be associated with a ribosome at any one time) and a large sub unit. The ribosome first attaches to the start codon on the mRNA molecule which is denoted by the codon AUG. Reading this codon causes a tRNA molecule with a complementary anticodon to become attached to the ribosome. It also causes another tRNA molecule with the complementary anticodon for the next triplet code in the mRNA to become attached to the ribosome. This brings the two amino acids on the tRNA molecules into a close enough proximity that a peptide bond can form between them (a ribosomal enzyme catalyses this bond formation). The first of the tRNA molecules then leaves the ribosome leaving a free attachment site for another tRNA molecule. As this happens the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand one codon. The above process then repeats until a STOP codon is reached. Translation therefore allows amino acids to be built into polypeptides as specified in the DNA that is found in the nucleus of that cell. Each time a single ribosome moves along a mRNA molecule one polypeptide is produced but usually a number of ribosomes can be found on the same mRNA molecule resulting in many polypeptides being formed. This is called a polysome system. These polypeptides may need more &lsquo;work&rsquo; to become proteins for that reason they often travel to the Golgi body where they are formed into the other levels of protein structure (secondary, tertiary etc).</p>

<h3 id="meiosis">Meiosis</h3>

<p>Meiosis is the form of cell division which takes place in the reproductive organs of animals and plants. The resulting gametes produced in this process are haploid unlike mitosis which produces diploid cells. This is important in sexual reproduction because it allows for genetic variation to occur. The first step in the meiosis process is called Meiosis 1. In meiosis 1 a pair of chromosomes (maternal and paternal) which have identical gene locations (loci) i.e. a homologous pair which code for the same features of an organism pair up. After they have paired up the chromatids of each chromosome wrap around each other and exchange in a process known as crossing over. After crossing over has occurred one chromosome from each pair is made into one daughter cell. Because of this step of &lsquo;halving&rsquo; the daughter cells have only half the required genetic material and so are haploid. These newly produced haploid nuclei divide again in meiosis two which is a process identical to mitosis. After this step there is a total of four haploid nuclei which each have a differing genetic composition. Once the cell has stopped dividing it is in interphase and the DNA present in the cell doubles in quantity and new organelles are formed.</p>

<p>Both meiosis one and two can be further split into phases. These phases are Prophase 1 &amp; 2, Metaphase 1 &amp; 2, Anaphase 1 &amp; 2 and Telophase 1 &amp; 2. The 1 phases occur during meiosis 1 and the 2 phases occur in meiosis 2.</p>

<p>Prophase 1 is where the chromosomes become shorter as well as thicker. They also split into two chromatids. If centrioles are also present in the cell they move to the poles of the cell at this point. Microtubules then extend from the centrioles forming asters which make up the spindle. Once prophase has completed the nuclear membrane breaks down and the nucleolus completely disappears. The following phase is Metaphase 1. In this stage the pairs of homologous chromosomes are lined up on the equator of the spindle in a random manner. This random alignment produces an independent assortment of chromosomes which in turn creates brand new genetic combinations. After Metaphase 1 is Anaphase 1. Here the chromosomes which make up each bivalent separate and one of each pair is pulled to a separate pole whilst its sister chromosome is pulled in the opposite direction. Because of the pairs being pulled in opposite directions and their random arrangement during metaphase each pole gets just one of the pair. The result of this phase is a mixture of maternal and paternal chromosomes and is called independent assortment. At completion of anaphase the chromosomes have reached opposite poles and the nuclear envelope as reformed around the chromosome groups. The final phase of meiosis 1 is Telophase 1. More often than not the chromosomes remain condensed and meiosis 2 occurs straight after completion of meiosis 1 as in plants where it occurs with no re-formation of the spindle. Unlike plants animal cells undergo cytokinesis at this point - the division of the cytoplasm to form two haploid cells.</p>

<p>Meiosis 2 has the same processes as meiosis 1. In prophase 2 the new spindle develops at a right angle to the previous (now old) spindle. Metaphase 2 sees the chromosomes line up separately on the equator of this new spindle each chromosome attached to a spindle by its centromere. During anaphase 2 these centromeres divide pulling the chromatids to opposite ends of the cell. The final step of the entire process is telophase 2. This occurs when the chromatids reach the poles. Here they lengthen and the spindle disappears as the nuclear membrane is re-formed. Cytokinesis then occurs to end the process producing four haploid daughter cells each with a different genetic code.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-meiosis">Importance of meiosis</h3>

<p>Meiosis is important for sexual reproduction because it produces variation but also haploid cells. Having haploid cells is important because it means that when two gametes fuse at fertilisation the resulting cell (the zygote) is diploid and so has the correct number of chromosomes. Genetic variation is equally important. The two events responsible for introducing variation during meiosis are crossing over between the chromatids of homologous pairs of chromosomes and independent assortment. Fertilisation also introduces variation due to the random fusing of gametes. All of these sources of variation aid in a species survival and providing the ability of a species to colonise a new environment. The variety is produced many different ways. The first is that the chromosomes making up a homologous pair carry different genetic material so that during sexual reproduction when the haploid gametes fuse the genotype (genetic code) of the mother and father mix. Arrangement along the spindle in metaphase 1 also adds variation when they separate independently producing daughter cells with a different combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes. The final way that variation can be introduced is crossing over in chiasmata formation (prophase 1) this allows equivalent genes on homologous pairs to be exchanged to make new combinations as well as separate genes that may be linked. This final method is called recombination.</p>

<h3 id="crossing-over">Crossing over</h3>

<p>Crossing over in meiosis is a key feature which makes it different from mitosis. Homologous chromosomes form pairs called bivalents. A bivalent consists of four strands made up of two chromosomes. These split into two chromatids which wrap around and then partially repel each other - remaining joined only at the chiasmata. At these chiasmata chromatids can break and later recombine with different but still equivalent chromatids.</p>

<h3 id="genes-and-alleles">Genes and alleles</h3>

<p>All living organisms have genotype which describes the genetics of that particular organism including the alleles or alternative gene forms that it contains. Linked to the genotype of an organism is the phenotype of that organism. The phenotype is the set of observable characteristics an organisms possesses as a result of its genotype. Genes are sections of DNA which code for a particular polypeptide to be used in protein synthesis. Genes are located on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are chromosomes which share the same length, centromere position and other properties. Alleles have similar gene loci on these homologous pairs. Genes are inherited and can determine particular characteristics. For a given chromosome locus there are a possible 3 allele combinations for a specific characteristic. The first is heterozygous, having two different alleles for a gene - one dominant and one recessive. In this case each allele will be present on a different chromosome of the homologous pair. Homozygous dominant is the second allele combination. In this case the organism will have the same two dominant alleles present which express the dominant characteristic in the individual. The &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; of this is the homozygous recessive combination whereby the organism has two recessive alleles for the same gene which cause the recessive characteristic to be expressed in the individual.</p>

<p>If an particular characteristic is controlled by a single gene then the organism will express the dominant characteristic unless they are homozygous recessive in which case the organism will express the recessive characteristic.</p>

<h3 id="monohybrid-inheritance">Monohybrid inheritance</h3>

<p>Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a single pair of characteristics which contrast each other. Gregor Mendel was the first person who worked out how genes are inherited. As a result of his experiments he formulated two laws. These two laws form the basis of genetics. Mendel&rsquo;s first law is known as the law of segregation and it states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every individual possesses a pair of alleles (assuming diploidy) for any particular trait and that each parent passes a randomly selected copy (allele) of only one of these to its offspring.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="dihybrid-inheritance">Dihybrid inheritance</h3>

<p>Dihybrid inheritance is where two separate genes are inherited. These are crosses between individuals with two contrasting traits of interest e.g. a white and large rat with a brown and small rat. In offspring there are four possible characteristics, in this case Brown small, Brown Large, White Large &amp; White Small. These characteristics express themselves in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. This ratio is known as the dihybrid ratio.</p>

<p>Using the evidence from his pea experiments and this ration Mendel proposed his second law that &ldquo;Each member of a pair of alleles can combine in a random manner with either of another pair.&rdquo; This law is also referred to as the law of independent assortment.</p>

<h3 id="codominance">Codominance</h3>

<p>codominance occurs when both alleles are dominant rather than one being recessive whilst the other is dominant. Because the alleles are both dominant they are both expressed in the phenotype of the individual. In most cases the expression of both alleles results in a phenotype that is midway between the two possible characteristics.</p>

<p>Examples of codominance include the roan colour in cattle which is a combination of the dominant red and white alleles and the pink snapdragon flower which is also a combination of the red and white dominant alleles.</p>

<h3 id="linkage">Linkage</h3>

<p>There are two key forms of allele linkage. The first is Sex linkage. Sex linked alleles are carried on the X chromosome. Sex linked alleles are not carried on the Y chromosome because it is significantly smaller than the X chromosome and as a direct result has very few genes. This means that recessive alleles on the X chromosome will always be expressed in the phenotype of a male because they are unmatched with an equivalent dominant form because one is not carried on the Y chromosome. Recessive genes on the X chromosome cannot be passed from father to son because for they son must receive the fathers Y chromosome. Daughters however must receive the recessive allele on the X chromosome. If the female only receives one copy of the recessive allele then they are a heterozygous carrier, if they have two copies however they express the characteristic in their phenotype. Female carriers have a 50% chance of passing on the allele to their son(s).</p>

<p>Haemophilia is an example of a sex linked condition. Haemophilia means that an individual cannot produce a clotting factor thereby preventing their blood from clotting and causing slow, persistent bleeding. The recessive allele codes for factor 8 (VIII) a protein which is takes part in the clotting process.</p>

<p>Whilst the symptoms of haemophilia can be minimised using the clotting factor from blood donations the chance that it may be passed on to offspring will always remain.</p>

<p>XH = Haemophilia
Xh = Normal</p>

<p>Linkage can also occur on other genes. Linked genes which are present on the same chromosome pass into the offspring remaining linked. Linked genes do not result in Mendelian ratios unless recombination occurs. Recombination is where alleles are exchanged between homologous chromosomes through the crossing over step process in meiosis. Since crossing over only happens in up-to 10% of cells undergoing meiosis that changes are the very few gametes will have recombinant genes and so practically nil offspring will have the recombinant genes. However the distance between each gene determines the chance of crossing over taking place with longer distances increasing the chance.</p>

<h3 id="sex-determination">Sex determination</h3>

<p>The final pair of human chromosomes - pair 23 determines sex in humans. Males have two different sex chromosomes one X and one Y. Females on the other hand have two similar X chromosomes XX. Because females are homozygous in terms of sex chromosomes their eggs only contain the X chromosome. For male sperm cells however because of the presence of both X and Y chromosomes in the parent the sperm cells contain 50% of Y chromosome and 50% of the X chromosome.</p>

<p>Drawing out a genetic cross for sex chromosomes shows that there is an equal (50%) chance of being either a boy or a girl.</p>

<h3 id="anaemia">Anaemia</h3>

<p>The gene that codes for Haemoglobin can undergo a point mutation in the form of a substitution which results in the formed Haemoglobin being Haemoglobin S rather than standard haemoglobin. Haemoglobin S is the form of Haemoglobin responsible for sickle cell anaemia. Haemoglobin S has the wrong amino acid in two of its polypeptide chains which causes the cell to become sickle shaped. Sickle cells struggle to carry oxygen so cause anaemia.</p>

<p>The gene which mutates is co-dominant. For a homozygous individual the individual will suffer from the disease. Heterozygous individuals however are carriers and have only 30/40% sickle cells with the remaining 70/60% of their blood cells having normal haemoglobin. This heterozygous condition is also referred to as the sickle cell trait.</p>

<h3 id="statistical-methods">Statistical Methods</h3>

<p>The Chi-squared statistical test can be used to determine if observed results are close to those which are expected or if something is happening to affect the results other than chance.</p>

<p>The Chi-squared test is carried out as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the set of expected values (E)</li>
  <li>Calculate the set of differences between the observed (O) and expected (E) results. This is done with the formula Sum (Sigma) ((O-E)^2 ) / E</li>
  <li>Calculate the &lsquo;degrees of freedom&rsquo;. The degrees of freedom are a measure of the spread of the data equal to the number of classes of data minus one.</li>
  <li>Using a Chi-Squared table the significance of the deviation can be determined. If the deviation is less than 5% then it is significant and an unknown factor is affecting the results.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mutations">Mutations</h3>

<p>Any change to an organisms DNA is a mutation. Mutations may be localised to one gene or may effect many genes, even the whole chromosome. Mutations are very rare because they occur randomly and in a spontaneous manner which results in a low mutation rate in a population. Whilst the variation caused by mutation can impact evolution because it provides characteristics on which natural selection pressures can act they do not have as much impact as other variation sources such as independent assortment.</p>

<p>The organisms which are most affected by mutations are those which have relatively brief lives. This is because as a species/population they undergo meiosis much more frequently than long lived organisms increasing both the chance that mutations occur and the overall mutation rate.</p>

<p>Mutations occur of their own accord but the mutation rate can be increased by exposure to mutagens. These are agents which cause mutations. Examples of mutagens include Ionising radiation (X-rays, UV, gamma), Viruses such as HPV, Chemicals such as tar in cigarettes. As well as these mutagens some mutations are linked to hereditary predisposition in which an organism inherits the tendency to have a particular mutation occur.</p>

<p>Some mutations can cause cancer, in this case they are called carcinogens. All carcinogens are mutagens but not all mutagens are carcinogens. Mutations occur in one of two ways: Incorrect copying of DNA and Chromosome damage. If DNA is not correctly replicated before cell division it can result in new faulty chromosomes. These mutations are often confined to one gene so are known as point mutations (sometimes as gene mutations). Note though that only mutations like these that occur in gamete formation have the chance to be inherited by offspring. Chromosome damage is usually reversible, the DNA that is broken will rejoin should the chromosome break. On occasion however the chromosomes may not repair themselves correctly - this is a cause of chromosome mutation and has serious consequences because it affects a large number of genes.</p>

<p>Point mutations can cause changes in the phenotype of an organism. When a point mutation occurs a different allele is produced. The point mutation can take the form of an addition, deletion, duplication, inversion or substitution. All of these mutations change the polypeptide produced in protein synthesis by changing the primary structure of the protein because if the modified amino acid which is built into the chain.</p>

<p>As well as gene mutations there are also chromosome mutations. Chromosome mutations are responsible for variation in the number of chromosomes found in cells as well as their structure. Chromosome mutations are most likely to occur during meiosis.</p>

<p>Changes in the structure of the chromosome that occur during prophase one are such an example. When the homologous chromosomes pair up and crossing over occurs they exchange in material may result in the wrong pieces being rejoined - this causes a completely different gene sequence and prevents pairing up from occurring in meiosis again. As well as changes in the structure of the chromosome they can also vary in number. Non-disjunction is an example of this. Non-disjunction is a process in which the chromosomes do not separate resulting in one daughter cell with no copies of that pair and one with two copies of the homologous pair.</p>

<p>Down syndrome is an example of chromosome mutation. Trisomy 21 is the most common form of Down&rsquo;s syndrome and is caused by non disjunction of chromosome 21.</p>

<p>Sometimes more than one chromosome is affected. Mutations in entire sets of chromosomes is known as polyploidy. If a diploid gamete (produced by meiotic error) is fertilised by a haploid gamete then the resulting zygote is triploid (it has three sets of chromosomes). If both gametes are diploid then a tetraploid is produced. Polyploidy like this is common in flowering plants (angiosperms like tomatoes and wheat) because it has some benefits for the plant but it can also be caused in animals when during mitosis the two chromosome sets (one from each haploid gamete) duplicate but are not then separated. When triploids are produced they are usually sterile because their chromosomes cannot match up into homologous pairs.</p>

<p>Although the term mutations has negative connotations they can in fact be beneficial. Beneficial mutations however are very rare. When they do occur though they provide a selective advantage to the organism increasing the amount of discontinuous variation in the population. Mutated genes however are often recessive alleles. As a result of this they have to be replicated in the gene pool a significant number of times over many generations so that the chance of an offspring having both recessive alleles and expressing the characteristics is large enough that it occurs with relative frequency.</p>

<h3 id="carcinogens">Carcinogens</h3>

<p>If a mutagen causes cancer it is called a carcinogen. Like other mutagens carcinogens affect the DNA in cells through mutations. Mutations in somatic (body) cells more often than not have no effect on the body because they are dispatched by the immune system. It is important to note that not all mutagens are carcinogens but all carcinogens are mutagens.</p>

<p>It is thought that the formation of a tumour begins with mutations in the genes which regulate cell division. These genes are proto-oncogenes and the point mutations that occur within them are sometimes unnoticed by the immune system leading to uncontrolled mitosis. Eventually the unchecked cell division forms a ball of cells which is called a tumour. Often tumours are benign, that is they are harmless and do not move from their site of formation. On the other hand some tumours are dangerous - these are malignant tumours. Malignant tumours spread through the blood and lymph as a result of cells &lsquo;breaking off&rsquo; from the main tumour body. These cells can invade other tissue leading to secondary growths. This is called metastasis and the diseases that result are called cancers.</p>

<p>Tobacco smoke is a good example of a carcinogen though it is the chemicals found within the smoke that are in fact carcinogenic. Nicotine and Carbon monoxide are amongst the harmful chemicals present. Tar which solidifies in the lungs contains many carcinogens which affect the DNA of cells in the alveoli. Oncognes (mutated genes which cause cancer) and bad suppressor genes cab both lead to lung cancer. This means tar causes 25% of all cancer deaths in developed countries.</p>

<h4 id="flower-structure">Flower structure</h4>

<p>Flowering plants are referred to as angiosperms. Angiosperms are the most successful of all terrestrial plants. Flowers consist of petals which are brightly coloured so that the attract insects, a sepal which protects the flower in bud and so often remains under the flower once it has blossomed. The flower also has both male and female reproductive organs. The female reproductive system further consists of the style which supports the stigma - the receptive surface for pollen. The flower also contains the embryo sac, ovule and ovary which are situated just above the receptacle.</p>

<p>The male parts of the flower are the filament and stamen which it supports. The actual pollen grain producing part of the flower is the anther which is also said to be male.</p>

<h4 id="pollination">Pollination</h4>

<p>The transferral of pollen from one flower to another is called pollination. Pollination generally occurs to the stigma of a flower that is of the same species. Pollination allows fertilisation to occur since it brings the male and female gametes together.</p>

<p>Some species of flower may self-pollinate. This is where the pollen from the anthers of a flower are only transferred to the stigma of that flower or one that is present on the same plant. Cross-pollination on the other hand occurs is the majority of known plant species and involves the transfer between flowers of different plants of the same species.</p>

<h4 id="genetic-implications-of-pollination">Genetic Implications of Pollination</h4>

<p>Self-pollination is analogous to in-breeding. As such it shared many of the same disadvantages. These disadvantages include reduction in variation and the size of the gene pool for a given species. Another more serious disadvantage is that two undesirable recessive alleles have greater chance of being paired in fertilisation if self-pollination occurs.</p>

<p>Conversely however self-pollination can help to preserve good genomes so is possibly more suitable if the environment that the plant currently inhabits is a stable one.</p>

<p>Flowers are adapted to cross pollinate through one of two methods. These methods are: insect pollination or wind pollination. Insect pollinated flowers often have colourful petals with scent to attract insects. Such flowers may also produce nectar from their nectaries in order to attract insects such as bees which feed upon it. Bees feed on sugary nectar and are adapted to do so - having long tongues so that they can reach the base of the flower where the nectar is located. When a bee enters the flower it also comes into contact with the male part. The anthers which brush against the bee leaving pollen behind - this pollen is the brushed off against a stigma of another flower when the bee enters it. The other method of cross pollination is wind pollination. Wind pollinated flowers have anthers that hang outside the flower as opposed to inside so that the wind can carry the pollen away. Wind pollinated flowers produce (large quantities) pollen adapted for this purpose - the pollen is smooth and light so that it is easily picked up by the wind. The anthers of wind pollinated plants can also be found outside of the flower. The stigmas are feathery so that they have a large surface area for &lsquo;catching&rsquo; the pollen grains that are inevitably blown into them.</p>

<p>Each type of pollination leads to an equivalent fertilisation i.e. self/cross pollinated =&gt; self/cross fertilised.</p>

<p>Though self pollinated species display less variation than cross pollinated species variation does still occur. This variations arises from the random assortment as well as &lsquo;crossing over&rsquo; processes that occur during meiosis. Mutation may also add variation to a self fertilised species of plants. Together this means that out-breeding becomes of greater evolutionary importance as some genomes will be successful whilst others will not.</p>

<h4 id="flower-sex-cells">Flower sex cells</h4>

<p>The sex cells of a flower develop in both the anther (for male sex cells) and ovary (for female sex cells). Initially there are diploid cells in the anther which undergo meiosis into haploid cells which later become pollen grains. These pollen grains are surrounded by tough walls which are resistant to desiccation. Resistance to desiccation is what allows the pollen grain to be transported from flower to flower without it drying out.</p>

<p>Further mitosis occurs in the pollen grain - dividing the nucleus to produced two nuclei. One of these nuclei will be the tube nucleus and the other the generative nucleus which itself will go on to generate two more nuclei which take part in double fertilisation. The pollen grains are not released until after this division and they have matured. When the pollen grain is sufficiently matured the anther becomes dried out (tensions are produced in grooves) and dehiscence occurs. This is the curling of the pollen sacs to reveal the pollen grains.</p>

<p>The female gamete (egg nucleus) on the other hand develops inside the ovule which is produced in the ovary of the flower. Inside the ovule a mother cell undergoes meiosis forming an embryo sac which is haploid. Inside the embryo sac eight nuclei form through mitosis - two of these are polar nuclei and one is the egg nucleus.</p>

<h4 id="flower-fertilisation">Flower fertilisation</h4>

<p>Fertilisation is the point at which the male and female gametes fuse together and produce a zygote. For plants to undergo fertilisation a number of steps must happen. This is because the ovule - that is the female gamete is protected by the ovary which means that the male gamete can only come into contact with the female nucleus through a pollen tube. The male gamete is the nucleus that is present inside the pollen grain.</p>

<p>Fertilisation begins with a pollen grain landing on the stigma. The pollen grain has to be &lsquo;compatible&rsquo; with the plant for fertilisation to occur. This prevents plant hybrids from being produced. Once the pollen has landed on the stigma it germinates in a sugary solution that has been produced by the stigma. When the pollen grain germinates it produces a pollen tube which grows downwards as a result of chemotropism. Chemotropism is the growth of organisms dictated by a chemical stimulus. In the case of the pollen tube the response is positive because the pollen tube grows towards the stimulus - in this case the ovary. As the pollen tube grows down it releases enzymes which digest the style allowing the pollen tube to pass through whilst also providing it with some nutrients.</p>

<p>At the tip of the pollen tube is the pollen tube nucleus followed by the male nuclei (of which there are two). The pollen tube eventually reaches the integuments and grows through a gap in them called the micropyle. At this point the pollen tube comes into contact with the embryo sac so the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates. The two male nuclei are then released into the embryo sac. Because there are two male nuclei a double fertilisation occurs. One male nucleus fuses with the female nucleus forming the zygote whilst the other fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm nucleus which is triploid.</p>

<p>Double fertilisation is a unique process that only occurs in flowering plants.</p>

<h4 id="seed-structure">Seed structure</h4>

<p>Seeds can be broadly classified into two groups. Dicotyledons which have two seed leaves (cotyledons) and monocotyledons which have only one seed leaf or cotyledon. The broad bean is an example of a dicotlydon whilst the maize plant is a monocotyledon example.</p>

<p>The broad been (Vicia faba) seed food store is absorbed into the cotyledons. Maize however often have endosperm consisting of cereal grain which surround the cotyledons. In fact the monocotyledon group includes cereals. The arrangement of food storage in the maize plant actually makes the maize a fruit rather than a seed which is the hard part within the maize (think sweetcorn).</p>

<h4 id="germination">Germination</h4>

<p>Plant seeds such as those of the broad bean (Vicia faba) can lie dormant for prolonged periods of time. Plants which lie dormant do not germinate until such point as environmental conditions become favourable for the survival of the plant. The primary requirements for a successful germination are Water, Oxygen and an appropriate temperature. Water is required so that enzymes can be mobilised and other nutrients can be transported as well as for vacuolation of cells. Vacuolation is the process by which plant cells become filled with vacuoles. The Oxygen is important because it is sued in respiration the product of which (ATP) is used as the energy supply for growth and other metabolic reactions. Appropriate temperatures for germination varies between different plant species but is always optimal when it matches the optimum temperature of the enzymes that take part in germination.</p>

<p>During germination the seeds food sources are mobilised but they cannot be transported in the seedling because they are insoluble in water. As a result of this the plant food sources are first broken down into simple but soluble substances which can be transported to the growing apices of the plumule (young shoot) and radicle (young root) through a water medium. Because of this vast requirement for water the seed takes water up very quickly in the first steps of germination. This results in the plant tissues swelling. The radicle and plumule of the plant grow in opposite directions, the radicle beginning its growth first and forcing its way through the seed coat which ruptures to allow it through.</p>

<p>Though there are a large number of enzymes which are used in germination amylase an enzyme also found in human saliva plays a key role. That role is the hydrolysis of starch to form maltose which can be transported to the apices (growing points) of the young plant. This is an important supply of &lsquo;food&rsquo; whilst the plant remains underground - for the broad bean the cotyledons remain underground through germination. The plant can only begin to make its own food when the plumule emerges from the soil and unfurls (the plumule is originally bent over to protect it from soil abrasion) to gather light for photosynthesis, by this time the food source that originally was stored in the cotyledons will have been depleted.</p>

<h4 id="fruit-development">Fruit development</h4>

<p>Shortly ofter fertilisation of the plant fruit development takes place. This occurs alongside the development of the seed. The seed itself develops out of the ovule and consists of both the embryo of the plant and a food store. These seperate components are formed from the double fertilisation that occurs in flowering plants though the embryo is developed from the zygote. To form the embryo the diploid zygote divides by mitosis. This forms an embryo that is made up of several components. These components are the plumule, radicle and cotyledons. These can also be referred to as the developing shoot, developing root and seed leaves respectively. There can also be only one seed leaf instead of two.</p>

<p>The food store part of the seed is developed from the triploid endosperm nucleus and provides a reserve nutrient supply for the developing embryo. Surrounding the entire seed however is the seed coat, referred to as the testa which is formed from the integuments.</p>

<p>Generalising these developments it can be said that the ovule becomes the seed whilst the ovary becomes the fruit.</p>

<h4 id="female-reproductive-system">Female Reproductive System</h4>

<p>A key part of the female reproductive system are the ovaries of which there are two. The ovaries produce the ova (eggs). Specifically ova are produced in the germinal epithelium where they become follicles, these follicles mature and the ova is shed. The ova then pass from the ovaries into the fallopian tube (also known as the oviduct) which carries the ova to the uterus. The uterus has muscular walls with a mucus membrane (the endometrium) and a large blood supply. Once the ova reaches here it implants if fertilised or is shed through menstruation. The uterus is connected to the vagina by the cervix - a ring of muscular tissue.</p>

<h4 id="male-reproductive-system">Male Reproductive System</h4>

  <p class="caption">Male reproductive system</p>
</div>

<h4 id="oogenesis">Oogenesis</h4>

<p>Oogenesis is the process by which the female gamete is formed. The female gamete is the ova which is produced in the two ovaries of the female reproductive system. In the developing female foetus Oogonia are formed which undergo meiosis to form around 2 million primary oocytes before birth. These primary oocytes also start division by meiosis but stop at the prophase one stage, they stop maturing until just before ovulation. Around this point the germinal epithelium also divides to form follicle cells. These cells then surround the primary oocytes to make primary follicles.</p>

<p>When puberty is reached hormones stimulate the follicles and cause them to develop further. This happens monthly and only one of the follicles fully matures into a Graafian follicle. The development at this stage consists of the primary oocyte completing the first meiotic division and so forming a haploid secondary oocyte as well as a polar body (the first of many polar bodies to be produced). The now matured graafian follicle migrates to the surface of the ovary where it causes the ovary to rupture, releasing the secondary oocyte in the process which is known as ovulation.</p>

<h4 id="spermatogenesis">Spermatogenesis</h4>

<p>Spermatozoa (mature sperm cells) are produced in the process of spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis takes place in the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubule - a part of the male reproductive system. The germinal epithelium cells divide into spermatogonia which themselves undergo division many times through mitosis to produce primary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocytes become secondary spermatocytes which are haploid cells through one meiotic division. Secondary spermatocytes undergo one further meiotic division to become spermatids which later differentiate into spermatozoa.</p>

<p>The seminiferous tubule where this process occurs has sertoli cells within its walls. These cells secrete a fluid which provides nutrients for the developing sperm cells (spermatids) and protects them from the bodies immune system which would otherwise attack them. The male sex hormones (androgens) are also secreted here.</p>

<h4 id="sperm">Sperm</h4>

<p>Sperm consist of a head piece, middle piece and tail. The head of the sperm contains the nucleus in front of which is the acrosome which contains enzymes for breaking down the walls of the egg cell during fertilisation. Behind the head is the neck and the middle piece. The middle piece contains a large number of mitochondria which provide energy in the form of ATP which is used in the tail to propel the sperm along.</p>

<h4 id="gametogenesis">Gametogenesis</h4>

<p>Gametes are haploid male or female sperm cells which are produced in the gonads. The process by which gametes are formed is known as gametogenesis. Gametogenesis can be further divided into two separate processes, one for sperm and one for eggs. Spermatogenesis is the process which produces sperm in the testes whilst Oogenesis is the formation of ova (eggs) in the ovary.</p>

<p>The germinal epithelium of the tests and of the ovaries go through a series of meiotic and meiotic divisions to form haploid gametes. The gametes must be at haploid so that when the zygote is formed it has a diploid number of chromosomes.</p>

<h4 id="sex">Sex</h4>

<p>To allow fertilisation to take place the sperm must travel from the seminiferous tubules where it is produced to the oviduct (fallopian tube) in the female. The sperm travels in a fluid called semen. Semen consists of sperm along with secretions from the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and Cowper&rsquo;s glands.</p>

<p>Semen is ejaculated from the penis into the vagina, the force of the ejaculation is large enough that it will propel some sperm through the cervix and directly into the uterus. The sperm make lashing movements with their tails to propel themselves into the oviducts. It is however only a small number of sperm which make it this far and only one that fertilises the egg.</p>

<h4 id="fertilisation">Fertilisation</h4>

<p>Fertilisation in a large number of animals is internal. This ensures that the sperm are correctly deposited in the females reproductive tract. Human sperm remain are only viable for 48 hours. This means that the sperm have to reach the oviducts as fast as possible. The sperm will meet a secondary oocyte in the oviduct as the oocyte makes it&rsquo;s way from the ovaries to the uterus provided that ovulation has occurred recently. Eggs also &lsquo;expire&rsquo; and the oocyte will die 24 hours after release if it remains unfertilised.</p>

<p>Several thousand sperm cells will surround the secondary oocyte but only one will penetrate through the follicle cells and the clear outer membrane known as the zona pelluda. For sperm to fertilise the egg they must first go through capacitation. Capacitation is a process which changes the membrane covering the acrosome and can take many hours.</p>

<p>Once the sperm comes into contact with the secondary oocyte and comes into contact with the zona pelucida the acrosome membrane is ruptured and enzymes are released. These enzymes act to soften the cells around the oocyte. When the acrosome becomes inverted it becomes needle thin. This allows the sperm to penetrate the now softened cells. This entire process is known as the acrosome reaction.</p>

<p>As the sperm penetrates the egg reactions are triggered in the oocyte that cause the formation of the fertilisation membrane. It is this membrane which prevents further entry by other sperm cells. The oocyte (nucleus) also completes its second meiotic division at this point. The two nuclei then fuse to form the diploid nucleus of the zygote.</p>

<p>The newly formed zygote divides by mitosis until it is a hollow ball of cells called the blastocyst. Travelling down the fallopian tube the zygote is continuously developing - after three days it reaches the nucleus and embeds itself in the endometrium. This point is called implantation.</p>

<p>The blastocyst which is now implanted in the endometrium of the nucleus consists of an outer layer called the trophoblast. The trophoblast will eventually develop into the chorion and amnion, two further membranes. The chorion will grow chorionic villi which allow for more absorption of nutrients from the wall of the uterus as a result of the increased surface area. hCG is also secreted by the chorion. Human chorionic gonadotrophin prevents the degeneration of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum itself is formed from the Graffian follicle after the ovum has been released. Detecting this hormone is the basis for pregnancy tests. The chorionic villi also later become attached to the developing foetus through its umbilical cord as the placenta.</p>

<h4 id="pregnancy-testing">Pregnancy Testing</h4>

<p>Pregnancy tests use antibodies to test for the presence of human chorionic gonadotrophin. hCG is secreted by the chorion (which later becomes the placenta) during pregnancy to maintain he corpus luteum and can be found in the urine of pregnant women. The antibodies used in pregnancy tests are monoclonal. Monoclonal antibodies respond to only one foreign antigen this makes them very specific. In this case the antibodies are specific to hCG.</p>

<p>hCG is produced during the early stage of pregnancy. The test requires that a reaction between the antibodies and hCG occurs to cause changes on a coloured latex to which the antibodies are attached.</p>

<h4 id="sub-fertility">Sub-fertility</h4>

<p>One in six people in the United Kingdom seek medical assistance because they have difficultly conceiving. Difficulty in conceiving naturally for any reason affecting either the man or the woman is known as sub-fertility.</p>

<p>Infertility on the other hand is the inability to conceive a child at all. Infertility unlike sub-fertility is a rare condition.</p>

<p>Infertility has two primary causes. The first of these is blockage of the fallopian tubes. This can be caused by infection but can be treated. For example by microsurgery. Any blockage of the fallopian tubes prevents the passage of the ovum to the point where it is fertilised making it impossible to conceive.</p>

<p>The second (primary) cause of infertility is failure to ovulate. Persons suffering from this tend to also have abnormal menstrual cycles. Treatment often takes the form of the drug clomifene which inhibits oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus.</p>

<h3 id="variation">Variation</h3>

<p>There are two types of variation. Discontinuous variation and continuous variation. Both types of variation can be caused in one of two ways depending on the manner in which the organism reproduces. Organisms which reproduce asexually such as bacteria, some plants and fungi can only gain variety in their population through mutations. Sexually reproducing organisms however gain variation through meiosis and fusion of gametes alongside mutations.</p>

<p>Continuous variation is where the variation occurs over a range of values. Examples of continuous variation include height or shoe size. Discontinuous variation on the other hand is variation in characteristics which are clear cut and controlled by a single gene. e.g. blood group (the ABO system) and other genes in which there are more than two alleles.</p>

<p>Variation also arises in two ways. Heritable variation is variation that arises from genetic changes. This variation is produced through three processes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cross fertilisation: when two parental genotypes are mixed.</li>
  <li>Crossing over: The exchange of genes between homologous chromosomes during prophase one of meiosis.</li>
  <li>Random distribution: the random manner in which chromosomes are distributed through metaphase one of meiosis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most often the changes that occur through these processes create a new combination of alleles in only a single generation. This is in contrast to mutations which often create long lasting variations. The problem with mutations is that the majority of mutations that occur are not useful.</p>

<p>This is also true for Non-heritable variation which is variation arising from environmental factors. An organisms environment dictates things like diet, light sources and availability of nutrients. These determine the phenotypic variation of the organism. That is the characteristics are shown in the organism. Consider that you inherit a number of genes from your parents which determine how tall you&rsquo;ll grow. You may not reach that height if you do not get appropriate nutrients. This is variation caused by your environment and is primarily the cause of continuous variation in a population.</p>

<h3 id="competition-1">Competition</h3>

<p>Population sizes are limited by the environment of the organism. As a population grows in size environmental factors act to keep the size of the population relatively small. This is a factor in the fact that often organisms do not reproduce to grow their population size even through the have the (reproductive) potential to do so.</p>

<p>There are only finite resources in an environment so organisms have to compete both among their species and with other species for resources. These resources include food, shelter, mates, light, space etc. Competition that occurs between members of the same species is intra specific competition, it is this competition that is the foundation of speciation through natural selection. Inter specific competition on the other hand is competition that occurs between individuals in different species. For example a predator - prey relationship.</p>

<p>Competition is a form of selection pressure. In predator - prey relationships for example predation causes an increase in the fitness (as in &lsquo;survival of the fittest&rsquo;) of the prey by changing the frequency of alleles in a population.</p>

<p>Organisms which are better adapted to their surroundings and environment survive to breed. This means that they pass their alleles on to the next generation. Less well adapted individuals are &lsquo;eliminated from the gene pool&rsquo; because their characteristics are not passed on to the next generation. The gene pool is the number of alleles present in a population at a given time and is determined by selection pressures exerted by the environment.</p>

<p>For a population that reproduces sexually the gene pool is large because of the large amount of variation present. To determine the proportion of occurrences of different genotypes in a population and so the proportions of alleles (allele frequency) population genetics is used.</p>

<p>The gene pool of a population is constantly changing. Some alleles grow to be more frequent whilst others less so. In some cases one or more alleles may be completely removed from the population. A gene pool is only as stable as the environment. A stable environment creates a stable gene pool but variations in the environment favour different alleles in different ways creating changes in the frequency of alleles in a population and so also in the gene pool.</p>

<p>A stable gene pool is known as &lsquo;genetic equilibrium&rsquo;. Genetic drift, natural selection and mutations are factors which act on the genetic equilibrium and alter the gene pool.</p>

<p>Of these factors genetic drift is perhaps the most important for all populations though it has greater importance in populations that are small in size or are isolated. Genetic drift is most important in small populations because the smaller the population the smaller number of individuals that may be carrying the allele and so the greater chance of those individuals not mating and passing the allele on to the next generation - possibly causing it to be lost from the gene pool. Genetic drift is also important in the formation of new species. When some individuals of a population become isolated the small population undergoes genetic drift which can make it greatly different in comparison with the original species (the parental population). This effect is known as the founder effect and is best demonstrated by Darwin&rsquo;s finches.</p>

<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>

<p>The theory of natural selection is credited to Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who proposed the theory after visiting the Galapagos Islands in 1832 as part of a scientific survey. The islands were particularly good for observing variation in populations because they were originally volcanic. Because of this when they formed there was no life present on them. This meant Darwin could conclude that all the plants and animals that were living on the island at the time must have flown or arrived by see from the mainland (the Galapagos are situated 600 miles off Ecuador, South America).</p>

<p>The theory of natural selection proposed that organisms which are adapted better to their environment relative to other members are more likely to survive long enough to produce offspring the are successful. The theory is based on observations that Darwin made, variation occurs in any population and individuals in a population can produce large numbers of offspring yet population size remains roughly constant. Based on this it can be suggested that &lsquo;there is competition for resources&rsquo;, &lsquo;only the fittest members of a population survive&rsquo; and &lsquo;individuals which survive have a selective advantage (they have the characteristics that allow them to succeed)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Natural selection is a continuous process in that as environmental conditions vary the characteristics needed to survive also change.</p>

<h3 id="speciation">Speciation</h3>

<p>Over time individuals the were originally members of the same species can become part of two completely distinct species. The formation of a new species is called speciation.</p>

<p>In a single species population there exist further sub groups called demes. Demes are interbreeding sub units which tend to breed among themselves more often than they breed outside their deme. A new species is formed when there is a &lsquo;reproductive barrier&rsquo; that prevents reproduction from occurring between demes. This prevents the &lsquo;flow&rsquo; of genetic material between demes and in the long term causes the two groups to be sufficiently different that a new species with its own gene pool incapable of breeding with the parent species is formed. The &lsquo;reproductive barriers&rsquo; which cause this are known as isolation mechanisms. The entire process is called speciation.</p>

<h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>

<p>There are two main forms of isolating mechanism that lead to the formation of new species (speciation).</p>

<p>The first of these is geographical isolation. Geographical isolation occurs through the physical separation of one or more demes. This separation can take the form of a river forming or an earthquake - any physical feature that would prevents members of the same species from interbreeding. This form of speciation is known as allopatric speciation and is very likely to give rise to a new species. A new species is said to have formed if the two populations have established a separate gene pool and can no longer interbred.</p>

<p>The second form of isolating mechanism is reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation itself can be further broken down into further more specific mechanisms: behavioural, mechanical, gametic, unviability and sterility. Reproductive isolation is caused when organisms which are inhabiting the same environment become seperated into two groups even though there are no physical barriers to their reproduction. This form of species formation is known as sympatric speciation and occurs between demes in the same geographic area.</p>

<p>Behavioural isolation is the mechanism that occurs in animals with elaborate mating rituals or courtship behaviour. The isolation occurs because the steps in one subspecies ritual fails to elicit and required response in a member of the other subspecies who is the potential partner.</p>

<p>Gametic isolation occurs in flowering plants and animals. In plants it is where pollination is prevented from occurring because the pollen grain does not germinate on the stigma. In animals sperm may fail to survive long enough for fertilisation to occur.</p>

<p>Mechanical isolation is simple that the genitalia of two subspecies is incompatible.</p>

<p>Unviability and sterility refer to properties of Hybrids. Hybrids are animals like the &lsquo;liger&rsquo; or the &lsquo;zebronky&rsquo;. Hybrid unviability occurs when even though fertilisation has taken place the embryo does not develop. Often hybrid unviability occurs because chromosomes no longer match each other for example having some chromosomes with different sizes or gene loci. This is the case in polyploidy.</p>

<p>Sterility on the other hand is caused because the sets of chromosomes in the offspring of the inter-species breeding can not pair up during meiosis because the sets of chromosomes from each parent are different. It results in offspring which cannot produce gametes - making the individual sterile.</p>
